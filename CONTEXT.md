# Vex

A KeyForge-style card game engine and (procedural) deck generator. This glossary
fixes the vocabulary shared across the engine, the card database, and deck
generation. It is a glossary only — no implementation detail.

## The game

The engine implements a KeyForge-style game; the **rulebook page (`/rulebook`),
rendered from the engine's typed rulebook term registry, is the authoritative,
comprehensive source** for how each mechanic works. The entries here only fix the
shared vocabulary — especially where Vex diverges from KeyForge.

**Æmber**:
The game's currency. A player gains Æmber into a pool and spends it to forge keys;
Æmber can also sit on cards (captured, exalted, or as a printed bonus).

**Key** / **Forge**:
Forging a key spends Æmber from the pool; the first player to forge three keys
wins.

**Key cost**:
The Æmber required to forge a key (6 by default), which cards may raise or lower.

**Check**:
The state of holding enough Æmber to afford a key; announced in the tabletop
game so the opponent knows a key is imminent. The client shows it as a glow on
the Æmber count rather than a callout.

**Key colour**:
The colour of a forged key — Red, Blue, or Yellow, the same colours as KeyForge.
Currently cosmetic; planned to matter to house Skyborn (set 8).
_Avoid_: Key type.

**Chains**:
A penalty that reduces how far a player refills their hand, shed over successive
turns.

**Active house**:
The single House a player chooses at the start of their turn; only cards of the
active House may be played or used that turn, barring specific grants.

**Phase**:
One of the eight ordered parts of a turn: start of turn, forge, choose a house,
archives, play, ready, draw, end of turn. Each phase is entered and left
explicitly, and abilities that resolve "at the start of your turn" or "at the end
of your turn" belong to the phase of that name. An effect may end the current
phase early, skipping whatever remained in it. KeyForge's rulebook calls these
divisions "steps"; Vex calls them phases everywhere — engine, rulebook, card
text, and game log.
_Avoid_: step, turn step, main phase.

**Opening hand**:
The starting hand each player draws during setup: the player who takes the first
turn draws 7 cards, the other draws 6.

**Mulligan**:
A player's one setup option to shuffle their whole opening hand back into their
deck and draw a new hand of one card fewer. Taken in turn order, starting with the
first player; the new hand must be kept.

**First turn rule**:
On the first player's first turn only, that player may play or discard just one
card from their hand of their own volition. Using creatures is unaffected, and a
card effect can let them play more — a card another card plays for them, or a
grant to play a card (Subject Kirby, Captain Val Jericho), does not count against
the limit.

**Reveal**:
To make a card in a hidden zone publicly known. Revealing is the only way a card
in a hidden zone is ever named — to the opponent, and in the game log.

**Reap**:
Using a ready creature to gain 1 Æmber, exhausting it.

**Fight**:
Using a ready creature to attack an enemy creature, exhausting it.

**Play** (vs **put into play**):
A card is _played_ when its controller plays it from hand — this triggers its
**Play:** abilities. A card that is _put into play_ (e.g. Aemberlution's mass
replay, Saurian Egg) is placed directly into a zone and is **not** played, so its
Play abilities do **not** trigger. Keep the distinction: put-into-play effects
never fire the affected creatures' Play abilities, so the active player never
resolves an opponent's Play abilities.

**Tactic** (vs the **Action** ability):
A **Tactic** is the one-shot card type — KeyForge's "action card", renamed so the
word "Action" is free for the "Action:" ability, which is used directly from a
card already in play. See ADR 0009. So "action" in this tree means a genuine
`Action:` ability (`ActionAbilityUsed`, `Trigger.Action`, the `glyph-action`
asset) or ordinary English ("the running action", "a result gate turns on an
action succeeding") — never the card type, which is `PlayTactic`, `inPlayTactic`,
and the `type-tactic` asset.
_Avoid_: calling the card type "Action".

**Omni**:
An ability usable on any turn, not only the active House's. Vex has no Omni
trigger — an Omni card is authored as the **Versatile** keyword plus an Action
ability (ADR 0009).

**Battleline**:
The ordered row of a player's creatures in play.

**Flank**:
The leftmost or rightmost creature in a battleline.

**Archives**:
A set-aside zone a player can later draw back into hand; may hold either player's
cards.

**Purge**:
To set a card aside out of the game; purged cards never return.

**Capture** / **Steal** / **Exalt**:
The Æmber verbs — capture moves Æmber onto a creature (off a player's pool), steal
takes Æmber from the opponent's pool into yours, exalt places Æmber from the
supply onto a card.

**Counter** (generic counter):
A card-placed marker that sits on an in-play card, stacks, and does nothing on its
own — its meaning is defined entirely by the card that reads it (a doom counter,
read by Wretched Doll). Generic counters live in one global side-table on
`GameState`, not a field per kind (ADR 0024). A **power counter** is not one: it
is a +1/-1 token that changes a creature's power, and — like damage and
Æmber-on-card — stays bespoke per-card state.

**Toll**:
Æmber the opponent must pay a card's controller in order to play or use an
artifact.

**For each** (vs **repeat**):
KeyForge distinguishes two kinds of repetition. **"For each X, do Y"** resolves an
effect once per X, choosing afresh every time (Mothership Support deals 2 damage
for each friendly ready Mars creature) — the engine's `ForEach{Times, Do}` node.
It is distinct from a card that says **"repeat this effect"** or **"repeat the
preceding effect"**, which re-runs an ability itself a bounded number of times;
those are the repeat family, not `ForEach`.
_Avoid_: naming the for-each node "Repeat" — that word is reserved for the
repeat-the-ability family.

**Rule of 6**:
A player cannot play and/or use the same card — or other copies of that card _by
name_ — more than six times during a given turn. The count is keyed by card name
across the whole turn, **regardless of who owns or controls the card**: six plays
or uses of "Bumpsy" in a turn, not six per copy and not six per player. Only the
active player can play or use cards during a turn, so there is no opponent
contribution to track; keying by name rather than by player is what stops a stolen
or seized copy from buying a seventh use. A self-repeating effect is bounded by
the same six: Bait and Switch resolves its steal once and repeats it at most five
more times, so one copy steals six Æmber at most. The count resets when the turn
does. It exists to stop an unbounded loop from hanging the game.

**Invulnerable**:
A KeyForge keyword: an invulnerable creature cannot be destroyed or dealt damage.
The engine does not model the full keyword yet — only the cannot-be-dealt-damage
half, as the `DamageImmune` flag set by the `CannotBeDealtDamage` effect (Shield
of Justice, Protectrix). Those cards stop damage only, so they are not truly
invulnerable.

**Hidden zone** / **Public zone**:
A zone whose contents are not known to both players (deck, hand, archives) versus
one whose contents are (play, discard, purged). The distinction decides whether a
card can be named.

**Upgrade**:
A card type attached to a creature rather than played onto the battleline itself;
it grants its host a bonus (power, armor, a keyword) for as long as it stays
attached, and leaves play alongside its host or on its own.

**Under** / **Under-card**:
A card placed under another card rather than played into a zone of its own —
Masterplan and Jargogle bury a card from hand this way, Graft always faceup.
Unlike an Upgrade, an under-card is out of play: it does not fight, reap, or
count toward anything power does. It may be placed face up or facedown; a
facedown under-card is exactly as hidden as a card in hand.
_Avoid_: beneath.

**Peek** / **Peekable**:
Looking at a facedown under-card without revealing it to the opponent. Only the
controller of the host a card is placed under may peek at it.

**Gigantic**:
A single large creature spread across two cards that are played together and act
as one creature on the battleline. It is two cards while out of play but one
creature while in play, and playing it counts as playing only one card (so it is
legal on the first turn). Both halves share the same name, House, and card type
(Creature); they pair by name, so any base half pairs with any art half of the
same name.

**Base half**:
The half of a gigantic that carries the creature's power, armor, traits,
keywords, abilities, and rarity. While the gigantic is in play, the base half is
the creature standing on the battleline.
_Avoid_: bottom half, "2 of 2".

**Art half**:
The half of a gigantic that carries only the bonus icons (plus the shared name,
House, and type). While the gigantic is in play it lends its bonus icons to the
one creature; it never stands on the battleline in its own right.
_Avoid_: top half, "1 of 2".

**Target**:
The noun phrase an ability names the cards it acts on with — "each enemy
creature", "another friendly Wolf creature". A Target is a base set (its Kind)
narrowed per card by one **Filter** and relative to the whole set by one
**Refinement**. The same value both prints the phrase and selects the cards.

**Filter**:
The per-card half of a Target: a predicate decidable by looking at one card
alone, however much board it reads to do so. A card writes it as one struct
literal (`card.Filter{Trait: card.Traits.Wolf, Except: card.Except.Focus}`),
never as a chain of methods. A rule that needs to compare candidates to each
other is a Refinement, not a Filter.
_Avoid_: predicate, matcher, criteria.

**Filter axis**:
One field of a Filter — one question about a card, holding one value at a time.
**Identity axes** (type, house, trait, name) are true of a card in any zone;
**in-play axes** (power, damage, position, Æmber, state, exclusion) read the
board, so a consumer pointing at a deck, a hand, a pile, or the turn log rejects
them at build time.
_Avoid_: filter field, filter option.

**Constant ability**:
An ability with no boldfaced trigger, which applies continuously while its card
stays in play — the power and armor bonuses one card hands its neighbors, a
keyword or quoted ability it grants every creature, a restriction it imposes.
It is not a triggered ability and applying it does not exhaust the card. This is
the only continuous-effect concept in the engine; there is no separate notion of
an "aura".

**Tagged for destruction**:
The window in which a creature is marked to die but is still in play — its power
is still computed, its buffs still apply, it is still itself. A `Destroyed:`
ability is a triggered ability whose trigger is _being tagged for destruction_,
so it resolves here, while its creature is still in play, before the creature is
considered destroyed. Distinct from the later moment the creature reaches its
discard pile (ADR 0030).
_Avoid_: sacrificed, marked (as a code term).

**After-destruction reaction** / **after window**:
A triggered ability on a _different, in-play_ card that fires once a card has left
play or reached its discard — Neffru's "after a creature is destroyed", Pile of
Skulls' "after an enemy creature is destroyed". The reacting card is the **source**
and is in play; the card that left is the **subject** (`it`). Not to be confused
with a `Destroyed:` ability, which belongs to the destroyed creature itself and
resolves earlier, while it is still tagged.
_Avoid_: leaves-play trigger (the card leaving play has none in KeyForge).

**Left play** / **out of play**:
A card off the board — in a discard, hand, deck, archives, or purged. A card that
has left play can only ever be the **subject** of a resolving ability, never its
**source**: writes to it no-op (the guarded write path) and no ability resolves
_from_ it (the source-in-play guard, RAW §190) (ADR 0030). "Leaves Play:" is an
engine-internal trigger name (`TriggerLeavesPlay`), not a KeyForge term, and it
fires while the card is still listed on the board.

**Settle** / **settlement**:
The state-based sweep (`settleDestroyed`) that destroys every in-play creature now
holding lethal damage or non-positive power, repeated to a fixpoint because
destroying one creature can drop a buff keeping another alive. Because power is
derived from the whole board, the sweep runs at each **resolution boundary** — after
an ability or a top-level action resolves, and before any choice — rather than after
every single change; new code relies on that boundary and does not settle by hand
(ADR 0029).
_Avoid_: validate, check state.

**Take control** / **latest ability wins**:
Taking control moves a card to your play area and makes you its controller;
ownership never changes and still decides where the card returns when it leaves
play. When two effects change the same thing on a card (its controller, its
house), the most recently applied one wins. An `UntilCardLeavesPlay` control
(Sneklifter's seized artifact) holds until the seized card leaves play; if a later,
timed effect overrides it, the `UntilCardLeavesPlay` effect governs again once that
timed effect expires.

## The game log

**Game log**:
The running account of what has happened in a match. It records outcomes — the
state changes that actually occurred — never a card's printed text, never what an
effect attempted, and never a hint about what a player may do next. It is
identical for both players and names no card held in a hidden zone, so a card is
named only once it has been revealed or has reached a public zone.
_Avoid_: chat, message, narration.

**Log entry**:
One line of the game log: one thing that happened, under one attribution. An
entry knows how to render itself, the same way an effect renders its own card
text; the two share a vocabulary of phrasings but neither is derived from the
other (ADR 0011).
_Avoid_: message, narration record.

**Frame**:
The scope a log entry was emitted inside, carrying who acted, which card the
ability came from, which ability category it was, and which card granted it.
Frames nest — playing a creature opens a frame, its Play ability opens a child
frame — and entries inherit their attribution from the frame they sit in. The
client groups a top-level frame's entries into one visual bubble.
_Avoid_: use, useId, bubble (as a code term), log group, log mark.

## Replay

**Command**:
A single player input crossing the engine boundary — a root action or one answer
to a choice the engine asked. Commands are the _causes_ of a match; the Game log
records the _effects_. The ordered list of commands, plus the initial seed and
Sets, is the authoritative source of truth for a match, from which its whole state
is derived.
_Avoid_: event (an `Event` is a gameplay timing key, not a persisted input),
input (accepted synonym, but Command is the canonical term), move, action (an
action is one _kind_ of command).

**Replay**:
Reconstructing a match's state by re-applying its Commands to a fresh game from
the initial seed and Sets. Because the engine is deterministic given seed plus
Commands, replay reproduces the exact state, the fully typed Game log, and the
undo history — none of which survive saving a bare state snapshot.
_Avoid_: playback, rerun, event sourcing (the units are Commands, not events).

**Session**:
The driver of one running match: it owns the Command log, the initial seed and
Sets, and the undo cursor, wraps the engine's step function, and hands out a
projected View. The client is a thin surface over a Session; a future server
wraps the same Session. Distinct from a Match, which only _sets a match up_
(decks, Houses) before a Session runs it.
_Avoid_: game (overloaded), controller, driver (as a code term).

**Request**:
What the engine yields when resolution needs input: a thin marker naming which
player owes a decision and in what context, not a list of the legal answers. Each
holder re-derives the legal Commands itself, since every client carries the whole
engine. A Request is answered by a Command. It is the mirror of a Command: the
engine asks with a Request and is answered with a Command.
_Avoid_: prompt (the Prompt is the _client's_ rendering of a Request), question,
choice, option list.

**Information barrier**:
A Command whose resolution revealed hidden information — it stepped the match
PRNG or looked at a hidden zone. Undo is free up to the most recent barrier;
crossing one needs the opponent's consent in networked play and is unrestricted
in a hotseat game.
_Avoid_: checkpoint, commit point.

**Projection** (**View**):
The redacted picture of a match a single player is allowed to see, produced by
`Project(state, viewer)`. It is identity today (hotseat sees everything); a
future server redacts the other player's hidden zones. A client renders from its
View, never from raw engine state.
_Avoid_: snapshot (a bare state copy, not a per-player view), perspective.

## Cards and sets

**House**:
A card's intrinsic allegiance (Brobnar, Dis, Logos, …). A Set groups its cards
into a small, per-set number of Houses (7 in a classic set, but adjustable).
_Avoid_: Faction (aspirational rename for later; today it is House).

**Set**:
The pool of cards a Deck is generated from, defined by the cards declared in one
`internal/cards/sets/<slug>` package. Membership is derived from the card
database, never from Provenance.
_Avoid_: Expansion, edition.

**Native set**:
The Set in whose package a card is declared. A card's home.

**Reprint**:
A card that appears in a Set other than its Native set. A card may belong to
several Sets at once (each new Set is ~half reprints).

**Provenance**:
Historical metadata tagging a card with the original KeyForge card it was derived
from (source set + collector number). It exists only to track which original card
each implementation is based on, so the author can confirm every original KeyForge
card is eventually covered. It is never consulted by the engine or by deck
generation, and a card's behavior never depends on it.

**Source catalog**:
The embedded JSON list of one original KeyForge set's cards
(`internal/cards/provenance/<slug>.json`), the data Provenance Refs point into. A
card records its `printed` name (the original) whenever that differs from its
ASCII-folded `name`.
_Avoid_: pack data, master-vault data.

**Collector number**:
The number printed on an original card, stored as a string. Most are zero-padded
integers (`004`, `151`); a set's reference cards carry lettered numbers (`S01`,
`A21`, `P07`), which is why it is not an `int` (ADR 0032).

**Reference card**:
A source card that is not a normal deck card: an anomaly (`S…`), a Worlds Collide
`A…` card, a prophecy (`P…`), The Tide, an archon power, or a token creature. It
lives in the source catalog like any other card, classified by its type.

**Provenance importer**:
`mage tool:importProvenance` — rebuilds a source catalog from the Master Vault
decks feed, folding each card to ASCII and expanding its amber/damage markup. It
replaced the removed `mage generateProvenance`.

## Deck generation

**Deck**:
The 36-card result of generating from one Set with one seed: 3 House pods of 12
cards. Reproducible only within a single version of its Set's pool.

**House pod**:
One of a Deck's 3 Houses together with its 12 Slots. A Deck is exactly three House
pods.
_Avoid_: House deck, deck-House.

**Slot**:
One of a House pod's 12 positions (36 per Deck). Carries an intrinsic Rarity and
independent provenance flags (Maverick, Legacy), the card chosen to fill it, and
any enhancements/distortions applied to it.

**Rarity**:
A card's intrinsic scarcity, which drives how often it is drawn into a Slot:
Common, Uncommon, Rare, Special, Reference.

**Special**:
A Rarity of houseless, very-rare cards. A Special has no House until it fills a
Slot, at which point it is stamped with that Slot's House.

**Reference card**:
An optional, Reference-rarity card filling a Set's Reference slot to support a
set-specific mechanic (e.g. a prophecy card). Chosen by the Set's own rules,
typically by card type. Most Sets have none.
_Avoid_: Fixed, token.

**Maverick**:
A Slot property: the card originates from a House other than the Slot's House
(same Set). For play it adopts the Slot's House (it is rehoused); the Maverick
flag records only that the card is a maverick, not its origin House.

**Legacy**:
A Slot property: its card is drawn from a Set other than the Deck's Set, same
House. Combines freely with Maverick ("Legacy Maverick").

**Legacy pool**:
For a Deck of Set X and House H, the cards of House H belonging to any Set ≠ X.

**Interloper pod**:
A very rare House pod whose 12 Slots draw from the same House in a different Set
(the House matches the Set, but its pool does not). Implemented as
`Tuning.InterloperRate`, rolled once per pod; every Slot is tagged Legacy.

**Errant pod**:
An even rarer House pod whose House is not native to the Deck's Set at all, drawn
wholesale from the cross-set legacy pool as that foreign House. Implemented as
`Tuning.ErrantRate`, rolled once per pod (before the interloper roll); every Slot
is tagged Legacy. The foreign House is one of the Set's **errant Houses** — Houses
present in the legacy pool but not native to the Set (`Set.errantHouses`). Because
an errant pod can bring in a House the Set never printed a member for, the
deck-wide Shard cycle resolves from a catalog-wide `ClusterPool` (see below), whose
gate requires a member for every House the Set can deck, native or errant.

**Errant House**:
A House present in the legacy pool but not native to a Set — one an errant pod can
bring into a Deck of that Set. `Set.errantHouses`, computed in `WithLegacy`.

**Cluster pool**:
The catalog-wide cluster index (`deckgen.ClusterPool`, built by `NewClusterPool`
from every registered card and attached with `WithClusters`) used to resolve
deck-wide `OnePerHouse` clusters — the Shards — across every House a Deck can
reach, including an errant House drawn from another Set. The two Shards no base set
printed (Saurian, Star Alliance) live in the **Anomaly Expansion** reservoir set so
the cycle completes across all nine Houses (ADR 0036).

## Card modification

**Enhancement**:
A bonus (Æmber, capture, draw, …) redistributed during the deck-wide finishing
pass. A card may be an enhancement **source** — it declares bonuses it contributes
to the deck's pool — and any card may be a **recipient**, gaining landed bonuses
(up to a cap of 5 per card, including printed bonus icons). A source does not keep
what it contributes. Because bonuses land per Slot, two Slots of the same card can
differ.

**Distortion**:
A generation-time transfer, resolved in the finishing pass, that weakens one
card's property to strengthen the same property on another card, capped between -2
and +2. Landed per Slot, like an Enhancement. Not yet in the engine.

## Scoring

**Bot**:
Vex's automated player: a procedural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) engine
that clones game states and self-plays. It is heuristics-and-search based, not a
generative or LLM model. It shares the scoring model with Deck Rating.
_Avoid_: AI (ambiguous with generative LLMs).

**Rating**:
A Deck's aggregate score, derived from the scoring model. Optional band-targeted
generation aims for a chosen Rating range. Because generation is deterministic
chaos, band-targeting is rejection sampling from a Set's intrinsic Rating
distribution, so that distribution (mean, spread) is exposed and reported.

**Scoring model**:
A learned table of per-card capability vectors and synergy tags, refined by MCTS
self-play (optionally seeded from a card's effect analysis). Consumed both by Deck
Rating and by the Bot's in-game play decisions, so the two share one notion of
card value.

**Synergy tag**:
A named axis a card _provides_ or _consumes_ with a weight. Deck synergy is the
weighted match of providers to consumers across the Deck; antisynergy is a
negative weight.

**Cluster**:
A family of related cards that deck generation places together. A card is a
**member** of a cluster; the cluster carries a **strategy** (how it fills out) and
a **trigger mode** (what causes it to fill). A cluster is the one mechanism that
pulls a card family into a pod — a fixed-count pull is just one strategy. Examples:
the seven sins (any member drawn tops the pod up to a random 3–7 of them), the
four Horsemen (a lead member pulls the whole family), the per-House Shards (any
Shard drawn places one Shard in every House pod of the Deck).

**Cluster strategy**:
How a cluster fills once triggered: **one per House** (one member in each of the
Deck's Houses — deck-wide, and complete by construction: every House must have a
member or the build fails), the **whole pool** (every member — the four Horsemen),
a **random count** in a range of distinct members (the seven sins), a **self pull**
(a random count of copies of the triggering member itself — Plague Rat pulls more
Plague Rats, at least a minimum, averaging a mean, only very rarely a whole pod), a
**pull exact** (one of each partner per lead instance — two Timetravellers pull two
Help from Future Self), or a **pull** (a per-partner random count of each partner
when the lead rolls in, each partner at its own rate — Troop Call pulls a couple of
Niffle Apes and, much less often, a Niffle Queen).

**Trigger mode**:
What fires a cluster: a designated **lead** member (Horseman of Pestilence pulls
the other Horsemen) or **any member** (any sin, any Shard, or a Plague Rat pulls
its family).

**Connection**:
The older name for a cluster placed by a fixed-count pull from a named partner
list. Subsumed by Cluster.
_Avoid_ for the general concept: say Cluster.

## Templates

**Card template**:
A parameterized card that is not itself playable and occupies a single pool
entry. Deck generation binds its free parameters to produce a concrete,
engine-ready card, including its name and boilerplate. Parameters may be
combinatorial (a mutant composed from two Houses, 7 home × 6 other = 42 outcomes),
enumerable (Master of 1/2/3 as one entry), or contextual (a self-house card whose
text names its own House).
_Avoid_: Generator, factory.

**Materialize**:
To resolve a Slot into a concrete, engine-ready card at generation time — binding
any template parameters, rehousing a Maverick to the Slot's House, and binding
Home-house references. Materialize may read the Deck's three Houses (an Ambassador
binds to another House in the Deck). The engine only ever sees materialized cards.

**Home house**:
A template parameter for a card that references its own House in its text or
effect. Bound at generation to the Slot's House, so a Maverick reads and plays
correctly.

**Partner house**:
A template parameter bound at generation to one of the _other_ Houses in the Deck.
An Ambassador (Sanctum) and a Plant (Shadows) each name a Partner house — one of
the Deck's two other Houses — chosen when the Slot materializes.

## The client

The names of the screen's regions, so a request or a bug report can point at one.
These are the names the browser client's regions go by.

**Board area**:
Everything but the Sidebar: the two Player bars, the Play zone between them, and
the Hand row at the bottom.

**Player bar**:
One player's summary strip — their name, Æmber, key cost, keys, deck Houses,
chains, and Zone counts. The opponent's is at the top of the Board area, the
active player's below the Play zone.
_Avoid_: score pill (the older name, still the CSS class), status bar.

**Zone counts**:
The out-of-play card counts at the right end of a Player bar — hand, deck,
discard, archives, purge — which open the Zone viewer.

**House strip**:
The three deck Houses shown in a Player bar, with the non-active ones lowlighted.

**Deck list**:
The full roster of a player's Deck — its 3 Houses each with their 12 cards —
shown as a popover from a deck icon on the Player bar, one column per House with
each card's type and Rarity. Any bonus icons a card carries (its printed icons
plus any landed by Enhance) render to the right of its name, tight together, like
the Maverick/Legacy marks. It presents the static generated roster, not the
live draw order, so it leaks nothing about the deck pile.

**Play zone**:
The four Board rows of cards in play, artifacts outside and battlelines inside,
split by the Midline. It is also the drop target for a card dragged from hand.

**Board row**:
One zone of one player rendered as a Row label and a strip of cards: an
_artifact row_, a _battleline row_, or the _Hand row_.

**Row label**:
The rotated caption on the left of a Board row — owner, zone, and count. It drops
the zone word for its icon, then the owner's name, as the row gets shorter.

**Midline**:
The dashed rule between the two battlelines; the board is a mirror about it.

**Sidebar**:
The right-hand column: Brand bar, Game log, Turn HUD, and the Control dock. It
can be collapsed to give the Board area the whole window, which sets the Control
dock loose to float over the board.

**Control dock**:
Everything the player answers with, as one panel: the Prompt, the Action bar, the
House picker, the Flank buttons, and End turn. It docks into the Sidebar while
the Sidebar is open and floats over the Board area once it is hidden, so hiding
the Sidebar costs the player the Game log but never the game.

**Brand bar**:
The title row at the top of the Sidebar, with the navigation buttons: undo,
redo, manual mode, new game, and hiding the Sidebar.

**Game log**:
The running record of the match. A _log line_ is one entry; a _log group_ is the
lines of a single action, drawn as one bubble; a _card mention_ is a card name in
a line, hoverable for its Card preview.

**Turn HUD**:
The at-a-glance state of the current turn above the Prompt — whose turn it is,
the turn number, the step they are in, and their active House.

**Prompt**:
A question the engine is waiting on, shown with the card that asked it (the
_prompt source_) and its answers as option buttons.

**Action bar**:
The buttons for what the selected card can do right now — play, discard, reap,
use, fight, end turn.

**House picker**:
The choice of which House to call for the turn, offered at the turn's start.
Distinct from the House strip, which only reports the three a deck has.

**Flank buttons**:
The arrow-headed buttons that place a played creature on the left or right flank.

**Manual panel**:
The Sidebar's manual controls, available only in manual mode: stat steppers,
moves between zones, and the Card picker.

**Card picker**:
The searchable list of every card in the database, for putting one into play or
hand in manual mode.

**Zone viewer**:
The overlay listing a player's out-of-play zones as rows of cards.

**Card preview**:
The enlarged face of the card under the cursor, whether on the board, in hand, or
named in the Game log.

**Icon strip**:
The thin visual band on a card face — roughly one and a half text lines tall,
below the stat area and above the traits — that transcribes the card's printed
mechanics as composed icons. It complements the rules text; the text stays
authoritative. A creature's strip is its own plus each attached Upgrade's,
concatenated.
_Avoid_: card image, icon bar, sigil line.

**Glyph**:
One base icon in the Icon strip's vocabulary — a noun (damage, Æmber, creature,
key), a verb or operator (deal, gain, destroy, the `→` result gate), or a
quantity rendered on the noun it counts. Glyphs compose spatially and may be
squished, overlaid, or combined to save room.

**Glyph decoration**:
A treatment applied to a noun Glyph to carry a Target filter without taking a
slot — an enemy tint on one edge, a friendly tint, an "each" stack, a "chosen"
outline. So `3 damage → enemy creature` is a quantity-on-damage, a `→`, and an
enemy-decorated creature Glyph.

**Iconography pass**:
The Visitor that walks a card's Effect AST (and its Targets, Counts, and
Conditions) and emits the Glyphs the client renders into the Icon strip. It is
the visual counterpart of rules-text generation. It type-switches over the
engine's Effect types but lives in the client layer, not in package engine, so
the engine's 100% coverage gate does not force an icon test per effect; it runs
in the WASM client, so no pre-rendered card art is served.

**Result panel**:
The end-of-game result, shown in the Action bar's place once a player has forged
their third key.

**Status banner**:
The transient message, usually a rejected play, that fades in above the Action
bar.

**Flash** / **Flight**:
The two feedback animations. A _flash_ pulses a card or counter that just
changed; a _flight_ is a card that left play arcing into the zone it went to.

**Tip**:
The small label a bare icon shows on hover.

**Style gallery**:
The page at `/style` showing every piece of the client's visual vocabulary at
once — color tokens, icons, fonts, card faces, a Player bar, and the animations.
It is a development surface, served only by `mage web`, and is not part of a
game. Its regions:

- **Specimen**: one displayed example, captioned with what selected it.
- **House grid**: the specimens laid out as House by Card type, whose gaps show
  which combinations the implemented sets have no card for.
- **Font compare**: the strip that renders one specimen once per loaded font, to
  choose between faces for the same House.

**Card gallery**:
The page at `/cards` showing every card in the database as a printed face,
filterable by House, Set, Type, and by name and rules text. Facets are _OR_
within a category and _AND_ across categories; the text box takes a small query
syntax (`term term` for all-of, `a|b` for either, `-x` to exclude, `"phrase"`
for an exact run, `\"` to search a literal quote). Unlike the Style gallery it is
a real, always-served page, not a development surface.
_Avoid_: card list, card browser, catalog page.

- **Style header**: the sticky controls for the fonts in use.
