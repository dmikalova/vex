# Writing tests

This guide explains the testing options in Vex, when to reach for each, and
what to actually test at each layer. It is the human-facing companion to the
per-directory rules: [`internal/cards/AGENTS.md`](../internal/cards/AGENTS.md) has
the full card-harness API reference, and
[`internal/engine/AGENTS.md`](../internal/engine/AGENTS.md) explains the engine
design the tests pin down. See also [architecture.md](architecture.md) for how the
pieces fit together.

## The short version

- **Engine rule or effect?** Write an **engine test** (`package engine`) against
  small blueprints. The engine is held at **100% coverage**, so every branch needs
  one.
- **A specific card's behavior?** Write a **card test** with the `ct` harness
  (`ct.Play`), one per card, reading like a game.
- **Shared setup / cross-cutting logic (e.g. `match`)?** Write an ordinary
  package test.
- **Hunting bugs no one thought to test?** Let the **whole-game simulator**
  (`internal/sim`) play random legal games and check invariants — run continuously
  in `mage ci:test`, deeply with `mage fuzz`, and at volume with `mage soak`.
- **Frontend glue (`web`)?** Largely untested by design (DOM-bound);
  push logic worth testing down into the engine or `match`.
- **Is the client wired up in a real browser?** Write a **browser scenario** — a
  whole player journey — in `internal/web/uitest_scenarios.go` and run the suite
  with `mage uiTest`. It is ungated and run by hand, never by `mage ci:check`.

## Coverage philosophy: what is gated and why

`mage ci:cover` holds **four areas at 100% statement coverage**, listed as
`ci.CoverGates` in `magefiles/build.go`. Each gate names the packages whose tests
run and the packages whose statements are counted:

| Gate       | Tests run               | Statements counted            |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `engine`   | `./internal/engine/`    | `./internal/engine/`          |
| `cards`    | `./internal/cards/...`  | `./internal/cards/sets/...`   |
| `cardtest` | `./internal/cards/...`  | `./internal/cards/cardtest/`  |
| `deckgen`  | `./internal/deckgen/`   | `./internal/deckgen/`         |

`internal/web` is deliberately ungated: it is a view layer the tests reach
through only a few entry points. The choices are deliberate:

- The engine is where the value and the risk concentrate — the rules — and it has
  no UI or I/O to dilute the measurement, so 100% is both meaningful and
  achievable.
- A new engine code path (a new effect branch, a new rule edge case) **must** come
  with an engine test, or the gate fails. This is a feature: it forces you to
  cover the branch where it lives rather than hoping a card test happens to reach
  it.
- Card set packages are essentially data (`var X = card.New(...)`); their tests
  exist to pin _behavior_ and _rendered text_, not to hit lines. The `cards` gate
  counts the sets against every test under `internal/cards`, so every statement
  in a definition, its helpers and closures included, must be reached by some
  card test. The `cardtest` harness is counted the same way, through the card
  tests that drive it.

Consequence to internalize: **if you delete or change an engine test, re-check
coverage** — a card test exercising the same path does not count toward the
`engine` gate, which runs only `internal/engine`'s own tests.

## Option 1 — Engine tests (`package engine`)

Internal tests in `package engine` (not `engine_test`) so they can use unexported
internals directly. They exercise the rules against a few **blueprints** defined
in the test files, not cards from the database — `engine` must not import the card
packages that import it.

Two shapes, depending on what you're testing:

**A single effect node** — construct it, assert its `Text()`, then `Resolve` it
against a hand-built context and assert the state change. This is the canonical
way to cover an `Effect`/`Count`/`Condition`/`Target`:

```go
func TestHealEffect(t *testing.T) {
    g := NewGame("A", "B", 1)
    src := g.AddToBattleline(testCreature("src", 5), 0)
    g.State.Cards[src].Damage = 3
    ctx := &EffectContext{Resolver: g, Source: src, Controller: 0}

    h := Heal{Amount: 2, Target: Target{Kind: TargetThisCreature}}
    if h.Text() != "heal 2 damage from "+SelfName {   // text and…
        t.Errorf("text = %q", h.Text())
    }
    h.Resolve(ctx)                                     // …behavior, from one node
    if g.State.Cards[src].Damage != 1 {
        t.Errorf("damage = %d, want 1", g.State.Cards[src].Damage)
    }
}
```

**A game rule** — build a small board with `started(t)` (a game with player 0
active and a house chosen) or `NewGame`, drive it through the public `Game`
methods (`Play*`, `Reap`, `Fight`, `EndTurn`, …), and assert state and returned
errors.

Helpers available (in `helpers_test.go`):

- `started(t)` — a ready game; `testCreature(name, power, opts...)` — a quick
  blueprint; `exGiant()/exBruteStrength()/exBattleFury()/exAutocannon()` — richer
  example cards.
- `handIdx`/`handIdxByID` — locate a card in hand.
- Custom **choosers** (`orderLastChooser`, `orderRejectChooser`, `orderAllChooser`)
  to drive or reject choices deterministically; the default `FirstChooser` picks
  the first candidate.

**What to test here:**

- Every effect's `Text()` _and_ `Resolve()` — they're one node, so cover both.
- Every rule branch and edge case: clamping (Æmber/damage never below zero),
  simultaneous combat and destruction ordering, empty-deck reshuffle, illegal
  actions returning the right sentinel error, `validate()` rejecting bad field
  combos, and the odd-but-legal boundaries (`maxCards`, over-heal flooring).
- Rendering rules that fold or reword text (e.g. Fight/Reap merging).

Because the gate is 100%, the practical rule is: **the test that makes a new
branch reachable lives next to that branch.**

## Option 2 — Card tests (`ct` harness)

Every card has its own `snake_case_test.go` in its set package, built on the
`cardtest` harness (imported as `ct`). A card test declares the whole scenario up
front and then plays it:

```go
func TestAmmoniaClouds(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("deals 3 damage to each creature", func(t *testing.T) {
        var toughFoe ct.Card
        h := ct.Play(t, ct.Setup{
            P1: ct.Side{House: card.House.Mars, Hand: ct.Cards(AmmoniaClouds)},
            P2: ct.Side{InPlay: ct.Cards(
                ct.Bind(&toughFoe, ct.Creature(ct.OfHouse(card.House.Brobnar), ct.Power(4))),
                ct.Creature(ct.OfHouse(card.House.Brobnar), ct.Power(2)),
            )},
        })

        h.P1.Play(AmmoniaClouds)

        h.Expect(toughFoe).At(ct.PlayArea).Damage(3)
    })
}
```

The pieces (full reference in [`internal/cards/AGENTS.md`](../internal/cards/AGENTS.md)):

- `ct.Play(t, ct.Setup{P1, P2, Seed})` builds the match with P1's house chosen.
  Each `ct.Side` sets `House`, the zones via `ct.Cards(...)`, and `Amber`/`Keys`.
- `ct.Creature/Artifact/Tactic/Upgrade(opts...)` build **vanilla** cards — a body
  with no baggage — for isolating the card under test; options `ct.OfHouse`,
  `ct.Power`, `ct.Keywords`, ….
- `ct.Bind(&handle, def)` names a placed card to reference later;
  `ct.Upgraded(host, ups...)` attaches upgrades at setup.
- Players act by def **or** handle: `h.P1.Play/Reap/Fight/UseAction/EndTurn/
ChooseHouse`. A choice among several candidates pauses — answer with
  `h.P1.ClickCard(x)` / `h.P1.ClickOption("...")` and assert it with
  `h.P1.ExpectPrompt("...").Source("Card")`. A sole candidate auto-resolves.
- Assert with `h.Expect(defOrHandle).Damage/Power/Armor/AmberOn/Exhausted/Ready/
Stunned/At(zone)`and`h.P1.ExpectAmber/ExpectKeys`. Drop to`h.Game()` for
  anything the fluent API doesn't cover.

**What to test here:**

- The card's _observable behavior_ end-to-end: play it (or reap/fight/use it) and
  assert what changed on the board and in the pools.
- The interesting branches of _that card_ — its choice being declined, its
  optional repeat stopping, a trigger firing or not firing.
- Vanilla creatures/artifacts still get a one-line test (play + stat check): it
  documents the card and guards its stats, and the card `var` loads at package
  init so untested-but-registered cards still count as covered.

**What NOT to test here:**

- Don't re-prove engine mechanics a card merely _uses_ — combat math, clamping,
  ordering — that's the engine's job and its 100% gate already covers it. Test
  what _this card_ adds.
- Don't reach into engine internals or assert redundant zone counts that `At(zone)`
  already implies. Card tests use the public API and exported card `var`s only.
- Don't hand-assert the full rendered card text in a card test; the card-text doc
  comment is generated and the `Text()` assertions live in the engine tests.

## Option 3 — Package / integration tests

Ordinary tests for logic that isn't the rules engine or a single card — e.g.
`internal/match` (deck construction) or the `cards` aggregator (database validity:
unique names, real houses/types, deterministic ordering, every creature/artifact
has a trait). Use internal (`package match`) tests when you want to cover
unexported helpers, and an external (`package <pkg>_test`) test when you only need
the public surface. Seed any RNG so results are reproducible (`match.New(..., seed)`).

## Option 4 — Whole-game simulation, fuzzing, and soak (`internal/sim`)

Unit and card tests pin behavior we _thought_ of. The `internal/sim` package plays
**whole random legal games** to catch the ones we didn't — a card that leaks Æmber,
a move-between-zones path that duplicates or drops a card, a turn that corrupts the
flat state. It is the property/simulation tier: instead of asserting a specific
outcome, it asserts that **invariants never break, whatever is played**.

**How it works.** Everything decodes from a single byte _script_:

- `sim.Simulate(script []byte) error` seeds a real `match.New` game (first 8 bytes),
  installs a `scriptChooser` for both players, then plays turn by turn. Each byte
  drives one decision — which house to choose, which legal card to play, whether to
  reap/fight/use, which target the chooser picks. When the script runs out, every
  read returns zero, players stop acting, and the game winds down to a natural end.
- After setup and after **every** action it calls `engine.Game.InvariantError()` —
  the one true statement of the flat-state invariants (non-negative Æmber, keys in
  range, `Winner` in {−1,0,1}, and **card conservation**: every registered card sits
  in exactly one zone or on exactly one creature as an upgrade). A violation is
  returned as an error naming the turn, step, and offending script.
- Because a game is a **pure function of its script**, any failure replays exactly.
  Persist the _script_, never a seed — seeds are version-fragile and carry no
  locality; a script is the actual sequence of decisions.

**Bounds.** Every game terminates: `maxTurns = 100` (50 per player) and
`maxDecisionsPerTurn = 100`. Those are deliberately far above a real game — a
marathon is well under them — so hitting a cap means a game that would never end,
which is itself a finding.

**Three entry points, one `Simulate`:**

- **`FuzzPlay`** (`go test -fuzz`) — coverage-guided mutation turns the byte script
  into a smart explorer of the game tree. Go stores the evolving corpus as tiny
  _inputs_ (not game states) in the build cache under `$GOCACHE/fuzz`
  (machine-local; reset with `go clean -fuzzcache`). A discovered failure is
  automatically **minimized and committed** to `internal/sim/testdata/fuzz/FuzzPlay`,
  where it then runs as an ordinary unit test forever after.
- **`TestSimulateSeeds`** — a fixed-seed batch of 5,000 random games, fast enough
  to run inside `mage ci:test` on every suite run. This is the property test that
  shakes the engine continuously; a regression prints the exact script to
  reproduce. The batch is **deterministic on purpose** — the gate never fails on a
  game no one can replay. Fresh non-deterministic games are the soak's job.
- **`TestSoak`** — the same games on a time budget, skipped unless `SOAK_DURATION`
  is set (`mage soak` sets it). It runs across `GOMAXPROCS` workers (many games
  per second), and where fuzzing hunts _new_ coverage and stops when it
  plateaus, the soak just runs
  _volume_ for a fixed wall-clock budget (nightly/CI). It does **not** stop at the
  first failure: every failing script is written into `testdata/fuzz/FuzzPlay` in
  Go's fuzz-corpus format, so a soak find becomes a permanent `FuzzPlay` regression
  exactly like a fuzz find, and the soak keeps hunting for more.

**The `assert` build tag (heavy checks in soak/fuzz, free in production).** The
engine carries a build-tag seam: `assertInvariants()` is a **no-op in the normal
build** (`assert_off.go`) and, in an **`-tags assert` build** (`assert_on.go`),
runs `InvariantError()` at every turn boundary and panics on the first violation.
So soak and fuzz builds (which pass `-tags assert`) validate the engine from the
inside as it plays — and the future MCTS AI, built with the tag, inherits the same
checks during rollouts — while production compiles them away to nothing
(`engine.DebugAssert` is a constant, so the calls dead-code-eliminate). `Simulate`
recovers those panics into errors, so an assert-build violation surfaces as a
reportable failing script rather than a crash.

**Promoting a failure.** Both fuzzing and the soak save a failing script under
`testdata/fuzz/FuzzPlay` automatically, so it re-runs as a plain regression on every
`go test ./internal/sim`. A crash is reported with its **stack trace** (`Simulate`
recovers the panic and attaches `debug.Stack()`), which points straight at the
engine line that broke. Once diagnosed, write a focused **engine or card test** for
the specific rule — the simulation finds the bug, the unit test pins the fix — and
keep or delete the corpus entry as you prefer.

**Where the coverage gate does _not_ apply.** `internal/sim` is intentionally
outside the 100% engine gate: it drives the engine through its public API and the
real card database (which the engine may not import). The only engine-side addition
it relies on — `InvariantError` and the empty `assertInvariants` no-op — is covered
by `invariants_test.go` like any other engine code.

- **describe / it via `t.Run`.** Model behavior as subtests: `func TestFoo` is the
  "describe", each `t.Run("does X", ...)` is an "it", and a `setup := func(t){…}`
  closure is the "beforeEach". This frees the `func TestFoo` doc comment for the
  generated card-text block (`mage generateComments` splices it above card tests).
- **Determinism.** Games are seeded (`NewGame(_, _, seed)`, `ct.Setup{Seed}`,
  `match.New(_, _, seed)`); the default `FirstChooser` and the harness's
  auto-resolve keep choices predictable. Never rely on wall-clock or map-iteration
  order.
- **Test at the boundary.** Prefer the public API and observable state over poking
  internals — except in `package engine` tests, whose whole point is to reach the
  unexported rule you're covering.

## Option 5 — Browser scenarios (`mage uiTest`)

The host tests above drive the client off-browser, where `app.Window()` reads back
empty: nothing proves the wasm bundle boots, the routes serve, or a click on a
real element reaches the engine. Browser scenarios are that coarse proof.

**One definition, two consumers.** A scenario is data — a name, a slug, a fixed
seed, and ordered steps, each a description plus a do/check against the live DOM —
registered in `internal/web/uitest_scenarios.go`. The page at `/ui-test/<slug>`
runs it in a browser beside a per-step panel a human watches; `mage uiTest` runs
the same page headlessly and reads its one status element. **Adding a scenario is
one edit**: `internal/web/uitest` re-describes no journey, it enumerates
`web.UITestScenarios()` and navigates.

**A scenario is a journey, not a widget assertion.** "Deal, keep both hands,
choose a house, play a creature, answer its prompt, undo it" is a scenario. "The
reap button is disabled when the creature is exhausted" is not — that is a host
test in `client_test.go`, where 300-odd of them run in a second. Every browser
scenario costs seconds of wall clock, so keep them few and keep them whole.

```sh
mage uiTest      # the whole suite, headless
mage web         # the same scenarios at http://localhost:8000/ui-test, looping
```

The driver (`internal/web/uitest`, every file behind the `uitest` build tag)
builds `web/app.wasm`, builds and starts `cmd/web` on a free port with
`VEX_UITEST=1` (it reads `PORT` from the environment already, so there is no new
flag), launches headless Chrome through [go-rod](https://go-rod.dev) — pure Go,
no Node — and opens `/ui-test/<slug>?once=1` per scenario, polling
`#ui-test-status` until its `data-state` leaves `running`. A failure is reported
with the failing step's own description. go-rod uses the installed Chrome and
otherwise downloads its own Chromium into `~/.cache/rod` on first run.

**It is not part of `mage ci:check` or `mage ci:test`, on purpose.** The build tag
keeps the package out of `./...`, so the shared project-standards CI workflow
never needs a browser, and a multi-megabyte wasm build plus a browser boot does
not belong in a gate that runs on every save. Like `mage profile` and
`mage trace`, it is a real target you reach for.

**The budget.** Measured warm on an Apple-silicon laptop: the js/wasm build is
~3 s (28 MB) and free when nothing changed, Chrome launches in ~1 s, the first
page load of the bundle is ~1-2 s and ~0.5 s after. Because the steps run **in**
the page rather than over CDP, a step is a click plus a render — single-digit
milliseconds. So the current minimal suite is ~5 s warm (~13 s the first time,
including the Chromium download), a fuller one ~10-15 s, and a ~50-journey suite
would be ~30-60 s — or ~15-25 s if passes share a page load.

## Running tests

```sh
mage ci:test                  # go test ./...  (whole suite, incl. the fixed-seed simulator)
mage testRun TestHeal         # only the tests matching a name pattern
mage ci:cover                 # the four coverage gates, each must print 100%
mage ci:fix && mage ci:check  # the local validator: autofix, then the full gate

mage fuzz         # coverage-guided whole-game fuzzing (-tags assert), 60s
mage soak         # volume soak of random games (-tags assert), 30s

# every target takes flags; mage wants -name=value, so no space after the flag:
mage fuzz -fuzztime=5m      # a Go duration, or...
mage fuzz -fuzztime=10000x  # ...an "Nx" execution count a duration cannot express
mage soak -duration=5m      # the soak's time budget

# focused runs while iterating:
mage testRun TestHeal
mage testRun 'TestHeal|TestAmmoniaClouds'
mage fuzzClean    # reset the local fuzz corpus if it gets stale

mage uiTest       # the browser scenarios, headless (outside the gate)
```

The debug and trace replays take flags the same way — `mage debug -script=<hex>
-tail=200`,`mage trace -count=25 -out=tmp/sim/mine.log`.

## Profiling and the local regression baseline

`mage profile` profiles the engine under the whole-game simulator — the closest
proxy the repo has for the load an MCTS bot would put on the engine, since the bot
does not exist yet. It runs the sim benchmarks in `internal/sim`, writes CPU and
allocation profiles under `tmp/sim`, and prints the per-game counts next to a
committed baseline so a regression shows as a delta:

```sh
mage profile                # profile the 1000 seeded games -> tmp/sim/cpu.prof, mem.prof
mage profile -random        # profile a fresh random batch -> cpu-random.prof, mem-random.prof
mage profile -save          # re-bless the baseline from the seeded run

mage profileServer          # open the seeded CPU flame graph in the pprof web UI
mage profileServer -mem     # the allocation flame graph
mage profileServer -random  # the outlier run's profiles
```

The workload is the `internal/sim` benchmarks:

- **`BenchmarkPlaySeeds`** replays the 1000 deterministic seeded games — the
  realistic action and allocation mix, and what the baseline records. It skips the
  simulator's per-action invariant audits, which are the harness's cost, not the
  engine's, and which MCTS never pays.
- **`BenchmarkPlayRandom`** is the `-random` outlier pass: a fresh random batch
  whose counts vary run to run, printed for inspection but never baselined.
- **`BenchmarkFastCopy`** copies the flat `GameState` — one undo/MCTS snapshot. It
  must report **0 allocs/op**; the baseline guards that, since adding a pointer to
  `GameState` (against ADR 0005) would make the copy allocate.
- **`BenchmarkSnapshotApplyRestore`** snapshots, applies one legal action, and
  restores — the MCTS inner loop. Split from `BenchmarkFastCopy` so a moved number
  tells "the snapshot grew" apart from "the action got slower".

**The baseline is advisory, local, and never gates anything.** It lives at
`internal/sim/testdata/perf_baseline.json` and holds only counts — never
wall-clock, so it is independent of CPU speed and its git history reads as change
over time. Re-bless it with `mage profile -save` when a change legitimately moves
the numbers. The play counts carry a small per-run jitter (the engine randomizes
map iteration per process, nudging a few script-indexed choices), so read a delta
of a percent or two as noise and a sudden jump as a real regression; only the
`FastCopy` allocs count is exact. Nothing here runs in `mage ci:check` or CI —
profiling is a tool you reach for, not a gate.
