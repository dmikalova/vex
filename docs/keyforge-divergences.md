# Vex⇄KeyForge divergence register

This is the single record of where Vex departs from KeyForge, and why. It is
one half of the split of the old card-wording document
([ADR 0019](adr/0019-controlled-rules-voice.md)): the wording conventions —
surface-independent house style — live in
[card-wording-rules.md](card-wording-rules.md); the deliberate departures live
here.

## Precedence

The precedence rule is fixed. Vex wins where Vex has decided. The
[KeyForge Master Rulebook](keyforge-master-rulebook.md) is the wording authority
only for what Vex has not decided. A later "match KeyForge" never silently
overwrites a divergence recorded here.

Matching the printed KeyForge text is not a goal in itself, and is never a
blocker. **Template consistency and simplicity across Vex outrank exact
KeyForge wording.** A meaning-preserving reword that puts a card in the same voice
and template as the rest of Vex — or that lets a mechanic decompose into
shared nodes rather than a bespoke one — is welcome, and does **not** earn a row
below: this register catalogs departures that change a **rule or a name**, not
pure house-voice alignment. Record a reword here only when it changes what a card
does or what something is called.

## Wording divergences

Each of these is a wording convention that changes a rule or a name, not just
phrasing. The convention itself — with its examples and affected cards — lives in
the numbered rule cited below in
[card-wording-rules.md](card-wording-rules.md). This register is the index that
answers "where does Vex diverge from KeyForge, and why".

| Divergence                                                    | Rule    | Reference                                             |

| House-scoped reap bar reads in the shared "cannot use" voice  | rule 32 | Seismo-entangler folds into `Restrict`                |

## Per-card rule changes

A few cards were changed in ways that affect the rules, not just phrasing. Each
change simplifies the card toward base-rules text, makes it slightly more
interesting, or brings it in line with modern errata.

- **Charge!** buffs all creatures, not just ones played this turn. The `you play`
  clause is dropped.
- **Imperial Traitor** reads `Reveal`, not `Look at`. This is the modern wording.
- **Ganger Chieftain** and **Biomatrix Backup** are mandatory. The `you may`
  clause is dropped.
- **Ghosthawk** is mandatory. The `you may` clause is dropped, so it reaps with
  each of its neighbors, one at a time. Its target is also reworded from KeyForge's
  `each neighboring creature` to `each of Ghosthawk's neighbors`, naming the
  source's own neighbors rather than the general neighboring-creature set.
- **Malison** is mandatory. The `you may` clause is dropped, so its Fight moves an
  enemy creature every time (the flank capture still only fires when the moved
  creature ends on a flank).
- **Hypnotic Command** leans on the base rule that the active player makes all
  decisions, so `an enemy creature captures …` needs no explicit `choose`.
- **Phase Shift**, **both Kirbys** (Com. Officer Kirby and Subject Kirby), and
  **Taber** play (or, for Taber, play or use) their off-house card immediately
  rather than granting a permission for later in the turn (rule 21).
- **Trust No One** is a `Choose one:` rather than a forced `If … Otherwise …`. The
  conditional branch ("if there are no friendly creatures in play, steal 1 Æmber
  per house among enemy creatures") still gates on the empty board, so it does
  nothing when you control a creature — a rational player picks the flat "steal 1
  Æmber" then, reproducing the original outcome, while the choice frame reads
  cleaner. Only a forced branch whose gated arm is a strict bonus over a safe
  fallback converts this way; most `If … Otherwise …` cards (random reveals,
  target-dependent or whose-turn conditions) do not.
- **Encounter Suit** is an upgrade that grants its host the reaction "After a
  Tactic is played but before it resolves, ward this creature." KeyForge phrases
  the reaction as the upgrade's own text and says "action card"; Vex renames
  that type to `Tactic` (rule 19) and fires every granted upgrade ability through
  the host, so it renders with the standard `This creature gains, "…"` wrapper
  like every other granted-ability upgrade.
- **Causal Loop** archives 2 cards, not 1. KeyForge reads `Play: Archive a card.
Archive Causal Loop.`; Vex reads`Play: Archive 2 cards from your hand.
Archive Causal Loop.` The card loops a card plus itself back into archives for
  no net gain, so a second card gives the loop something to carry.
- **Keyforgery** drops the trailing `(no Æmber is spent)` clarifier. Vex
  prevents the forge before any Æmber leaves the pool, so the clause states a
  consequence the mechanic already guarantees; the Rules voice omits such
  parenthetical asides.
- **Tantadlin** reads `Your opponent discards a random card from their archives`,
  not KeyForge's imperative `Discard a random card from your opponent's archives`.
  A random discard is the discarding player's own act, so Vex renders it in
  the actor's voice — the same voice Mind Barb already uses for a random hand
  discard. The effect is identical; only the voice changes.
- **Hunter or Hunted?** reads `Remove a ward from a creature, and ward a creature`
  rather than KeyForge's `Choose one: Ward a creature / Move a ward from a creature
to another creature`. The two branches collapse into one linear sequence:
  removing a ward and then placing a fresh one reproduces the "move a ward" branch
  when the same source and destination are chosen, and the "ward only" branch when
  the removal finds no ward. Vex keeps the two atomic effects — `RemoveWard`
  (any creature, warded or not) then `Ward` — instead of a bespoke `MoveWard` node,
  so there is one fewer one-off mechanic to carry.
- **Bait and Switch** reads `Steal 1 Æmber -> if your opponent has more Æmber than
you, repeat this effect`, not KeyForge's`If your opponent has more Æmber than
you, steal 1 Æmber. Repeat this effect`. Vex uniformly writes a self-repeat as
  `<do> -> if <cond>, repeat this effect` (the same shape Numquid the Fair and
  Neutron Shark use), so the steal leads and the condition gates the repeat. The
  first steal is therefore unconditional: with equal pools KeyForge steals nothing
  while Vex steals 1, then stops. In every case where the opponent already
  leads the two are identical.- **Gebuk** swaps the discarded creature into play immediately rather than waiting
  until it has left play. KeyForge reads "Destroyed: ... **after Gebuk leaves
  play**, put that creature into play in Gebuk's position"; Vex reads
  "Destroyed: Discard the top card of your deck. If it is a creature, swap it with
  Gebuk." The discarded creature and Gebuk exchange places in one step during
  Gebuk's Destroyed ability — Gebuk leaves to the discard pile (still counting as
  destroyed, since the destruction window already enrolled it) and the creature
  enters play in Gebuk's slot. This drops the deferred "after ... leaves play"
  ability memory in favor of an immediate, self-contained swap, and reuses the
  shared swap mechanic (SwapCards) instead of a bespoke delayed put-into-play
  registry. Because the swap resolves mid-window, a second Destroyed ability on
  Gebuk would fizzle (Gebuk is already out of play), and the swapped-in creature
  is on the board in time to be caught by the same destruction window (an
  enters-play "deal damage" can destroy it, and its own Destroyed ability then
  resolves in that window).
- **Harvest Time** reads `Choose a creature. Purge each creature that shares a
trait with the chosen creature`, not KeyForge's`Choose a trait. Purge each card
with that trait`. Vex reuses the shared choose-a-creature-then-fold-on-a-
  shared-trait mechanic (the same `ChooseCreatureThen` + `SharingTrait` pair
  Extinction uses) instead of a bespoke choose-a-trait purge, so the purge is
  anchored to a creature on the board and hits creatures only (artifacts are no
  longer swept). The chosen creature shares every trait with itself, so it is
  always among the purged. The per-player payout is unchanged: each player gains 1
  Æmber for each card they controlled that was purged this way.
- **Old Boomy** reads `Discard cards from the top of your deck until you discard a
Brobnar card or choose to stop -> deal 2 damage to Old Boomy. Archive each card
discarded this way`, not KeyForge's`Reveal cards from the top of your deck until
you reveal a Brobnar card or choose to stop. Deal 2 damage to Old Boomy if a
Brobnar card was revealed. Archive each card revealed this way`. Vex folds the
  card into the shared deck-dig family (`DiscardUntil`, the same node Sound
  the Horns and Invasion Portal use) instead of a bespoke reveal-and-archive loop:
  each card is discarded as the dig walks the deck, then the whole run is archived as
  a distinct step (`ArchiveDiscardedThisWay`). The end state is identical — every
  walked card ends in archives and Old Boomy takes 2 damage only when a Brobnar card
  is turned up — but the cards pass through the discard pile en route to archives
  rather than being archived directly on reveal.
- **The Worlds Collide "Brews"** are each redesigned to be unique to the giant they
  are brewed for, rather than sharing KeyForge's single `Play: Give a creature two
+1 power counters` action. Each brew is a Brobnar **Upgrade** that leads a Pull
  cluster bringing its Mega giant into the pod, and grants its host an ability tied
  to that giant: **Chieftain's Brew** grants `Fight: Ready and fight with a
neighboring Creature` (Mega Ganger Chieftain's play ability), **Cowfyne's Brew**
  grants `+2 splash-attack` (Mega Cowfyne's keyword), and **Alaka's Brew** grants
  `Fight: Play a Creature -> ready it`. This makes each brew a distinct card and
  keeps the Mega giants — which are `Connected` — reachable through their brew's
  cluster.
- **Mega Cowfyne** has **Splash-attack 2** rather than KeyForge's `Before Fight:
Deal 2 damage to each neighbor of the creature Mega Cowfyne fights`. The keyword
  reaches the same neighbours for the same 2 damage while folding the card into the
  shared Splash-attack mechanic (the same keyword base Cowfyne already carries),
  and **Cowfyne's Brew** grants that keyword instead of the bespoke reaction.
- **Mega Ganger Chieftain** and **Chieftain's Brew** are mandatory: the `you may`
  is dropped from Mega Ganger Chieftain's `Play` and from the `Fight` ability
  Chieftain's Brew grants, matching the same drop already made on their base card
  **Ganger Chieftain**.
- **Mind Barb** reads `Play: Discard a card from your hand. Your opponent discards
a random card from their hand`, adding a self-discard before KeyForge's lone
  `Play: Your opponent discards a random card from their hand`. The extra clause
  makes the card distinct from its cross-house counterpart **Subtle Chain**
  (Shadows), which keeps the original opponent-only discard.
- **Speed Sigil** is limited to one copy per deck. KeyForge sets no such limit;
  Vex caps it at one to bound its first-creature-of-the-turn ready loop.
- **Toad** is `Connected` rather than KeyForge's `Special`: it is kept out of the
  pool and instead pulled into **Xenos Bloodshadow**'s pod one for one, so a Toad
  only ever reaches a deck alongside the Bloodshadow it rides in with.
- **Rustgnawer** reads `Fight: Destroy an artifact. Resolve the bonus icons on
it`, not KeyForge's`Fight: Destroy an artifact. If that artifact had an Æmber
bonus, you gain that much Æmber`. Instead of refunding only the Æmber bonus,
  Vex resolves the whole bonus-icon strip on the destroyed artifact — capture,
  draw, and damage icons resolve too (rule 27). This is a small power increase and
  lets the card reuse the shared `ResolveBonusIcons` mechanic instead of a one-off
  Æmber-bonus count node. On the common case (an artifact whose only bonus is
  Æmber) the outcome is identical.
- **J43G3R V** is mandatory and immediate: it reads `Reap: Reap with 2 non-Star
Alliance creatures, one at a time`and`Fight: Fight with 2 non-Star Alliance
creatures, one at a time`, not KeyForge's deferred`After Reap: You may reap with
up to 2 non-Star Alliance creatures this turn` (and the matching Fight permission).
  The `you may … up to 2 … this turn` permission is dropped in favor of an
  immediate use of the same creatures, one at a time — the same move already made
  on Ghosthawk (mandatory neighbor reaps) and the play-permission cards under
  rule 21. This drops the turn-scoped unused-permission memory and folds the card
  into the shared `Use` mechanic (a `Verb`-restricted use, the same node Combat
  Pheromones uses) instead of a bespoke deferred grant.
- **Bawretchadontius** carries the `Beast` trait, which its KeyForge printing
  lacks (it is printed traitless). Vex requires every creature to hold at least
  one trait (`TestEveryCreatureAndArtifactHasTrait`), so a traitless gigantic
  creature is given `Beast` — the trait that names what it is.
- **Boosted B4-RRY** rewords both halves of its `Choose one` to reuse shared
  mechanics. Its take-control half reads `Take control of an enemy artifact. If it
does not belong to a house on your identity, it belongs to house Shadows until it
leaves play`, dropping KeyForge's`while under your control` scoping in favor of
  the same `TakeControl{UntilCardLeavesPlay}` + off-identity `BelongToHouse` pattern Sneklifter
  uses — the control is permanent, so the house holds until the artifact leaves
  play rather than until control reverts (it never does). Its archives half reads
  `Play a random card from your opponent's archives`, dropping `as if it were
yours`; the card is played as your own but stays owned by, and returns to, the
  opponent — the shared `PlayFromOpponent` model Murkens uses. The archives are
  facedown, so the played card is always random (it cannot be chosen).

- **Animator** reads `Action: Give an artifact three +1 power counters. Move it to
a flank of its controller's battleline as a creature with versatile for the
remainder of the turn.`KeyForge's`it belongs to the active house` clause is
  re-expressed as **versatile** (the newer keyword that lets a creature be used as
  if in the active house), so the animated artifact is still usable the turn it is
  animated — a meaning-preserving reword, not a rule change. The three +1 power
  counters are permanent (they persist when the card reverts to an artifact at end
  of turn), so re-animating the same artifact on a later turn stacks another three
  and it enters larger each time. Built on `AddPowerCounter` (which leaves the
  chosen artifact in context) + a `RemainderOfPlayerTurn` `TurnIntoCreature` with
  `Versatile`, whose end-of-turn revert the ready phase performs.
- **Cyber-Clone** copies the purged creature's **printed** power, armor, keywords,
  and traits, not its live stats at the moment of purge. KeyForge reads `it has
power equal to the purged creature's power, and gains that creature's armor,
keywords, and traits`; Vex reads`Cyber-Clone has power equal to the same
creature's printed power and gains its printed armor, keywords, and traits`. The
  purged creature is out of play, so its counters, buffs, and other live
  modifications are gone; only the printed stats from the immutable card catalog
  remain to copy. So a creature buffed to power 8 (printed 4) is copied as a 4, and
  a stripped-armor creature is copied at its printed armor. Power is an override
  (Cyber-Clone's printed 1 becomes the source's printed power); armor, keywords,
  and traits are gained on top of Cyber-Clone's own (it stays a Mutant and keeps
  any armor of its own). Built on the shared `CopyPrintedStats` effect, stored flat
  as the source's id on Cyber-Clone until it leaves play.
- **The Archivist** grants its selective archive pickup **while it is in play**,
  not while it is in your archives. KeyForge reads `If you archive The Archivist,
archive it faceup. While The Archivist is in your archives, instead of picking up
all of your archives, you may choose to pick up any number of cards in your
archives.` Vex drops the faceup-archive clause and the while-in-archives
  scope, and reads `Instead of picking up all of your archives, you may pick up any
number of cards in your archives.` — a constant ability active while The Archivist
  is a creature in play. Vex has no facedown/faceup distinction for archived
  cards and no while-in-archives trigger scope, so the rule is re-hung on the
  card's presence in play. Built on the shared `ConstantAbility.SelectiveArchivePickup`
  field, which the house-choice archive offer consults for the controller.

## Invented cards

A few cards exist only in Vex — no KeyForge printing. They fill a structural
gap the real game left open and carry provisional abilities that may be retuned.

- **Shard of Glory** (Saurian) and **Shard of Unity** (Star Alliance) complete the
  nine-House Shard cycle. Age of Ascension printed seven Shards, one per its Houses,
  but never a Saurian or Star Alliance Shard, so an errant pod of either House (or a
  legacy-drawn Shard in a deck of those Houses) could not complete the deck-wide
  `OnePerHouse` cluster ([ADR 0036](adr/0036-clusters-place-card-families-by-strategy.md)).
  Both are `Connected` Artifacts in the **Anomaly Expansion** reservoir set,
  matching the AoA Shards' shape (Item • Shard, one copy per deck, `Action: For each
friendly Shard, …`). Their effects — Shard of Glory exalts a friendly creature,
  Shard of Unity readies a friendly creature — are Vex inventions in the spirit
  of the existing Shards and are provisional; only their existence and cross-set
  cycle role are load-bearing.

## Mechanic rule changes

- **Key cheats purge themselves.** Any card that forges a key outside the normal
  start-of-turn step spends itself when it succeeds: a forge that actually lands
  purges the card that made it, gated with the `->` result arrow (rule 5) as
  `… forge a key … -> purge <self>`. A forge that is barred or unaffordable does
  not purge — the card stays. This keeps a single key cheat from looping a body
  back into play to forge again and again in one turn (Chota Hazri regrowth), while
  leaving its ordinary tactical use intact. The rule lives on the `ForgeKey` effect
  node, so every forge card carries it uniformly (Data Forge, Imperial Forge,
  Forging an Alliance, Key of Darkness, Key Charge, Chota Hazri, The Colosseum,
  Nightforge, Key Abduction, Triumph, Might Makes Right, [REDACTED], Epic Quest,
  Obsidian Forge). Because the forge is now its own cost, the optional wrapper is
  dropped from the four key cheats that carried one — **Nightforge**, **Obsidian
  Forge**, **Data Forge** (printed `Play: You may forge a key at +10 Aember current
  cost, reduced by 1 Aember for each card in your hand.`) and **Key Abduction**
  (printed `Then, you may forge a key at +9A current cost, …`) are mandatory when
  affordable (the `you may` is gone) — and the cards
  that used to **destroy** themselves on forging (**Epic Quest**, **[REDACTED]**,
  **Obsidian Forge**) now **purge** instead, removing them from the game rather
  than sending them to the discard pile where they could return.
  **Keyfrog** (Untamed creature, MM #369) inherits this rule too: its printed
  `Destroyed: Forge a key at current cost.` has no purge — a destroyed creature
  discards normally — but its `ForgeKey` node adds the shared `-> purge Keyfrog`,
  so a Keyfrog that lands its forge is purged rather than discarded. This is the
  same anti-regrowth divergence (a returned Keyfrog cannot loop its Destroyed
  forge), applied to a creature whose forge fires from its Destroyed trigger.
  **Desire** (Dis creature, MM #053) purges itself too: its `Reap: Forge a key at
current cost, reduced by 1 Æmber for each friendly Sin creature -> purge Desire`
  spends the creature the moment a key lands, so a repeatable reap engine cannot
  keep forging turn after turn. The rule has **no exception** — every key cheat
  purges itself on a successful forge, creatures included — so the `ForgeKey` node
  carries no opt-out flag.
  **Re-examined 2026-09-26 and upheld.** The case against the rule is real: it
  diverges from 15 printed card texts that name no self-removal, and it caps two
  cards whose printed design is repeatable — The Colosseum's "remove 6 glory
  counters and forge" and Desire's `After Reap: forge` can each land exactly one
  key before the card is spent. It was kept anyway, because it is the single rule
  stopping a discard-recursion loop from replaying a free-forge card several times
  in one turn, and one uniform rule on the node beats a per-card opt-out. Do not
  re-file the reversal as a new finding.
- **A bonus icon's source is the card that carries it.** When a bonus icon
  resolves (Æmber, Capture, Damage, Draw), KeyForge treats the game itself as the
  source of the effect; Vex treats the card the icon is printed on as the
  source. This only matters for the rare card that reads the source of a bonus
  icon's damage, and it makes the log read naturally ("Splinter deals 1 bonus
  damage to …"). See [ADR 0041](adr/0041-bonus-icons-are-the-primitive.md).

- **A creature stops resolving its bonus icons when it leaves play.** KeyForge
  resolves every bonus icon on a played card even after the card has left play (a
  Damage icon that destroys its own creature still resolves the icons below it).
  In Vex, once a creature leaves play — destroyed by a constant ability before
  its icons resolve, or by its own Damage icon aimed at itself mid-resolution — its
  remaining icons do not resolve. Only creatures are gated this way: an artifact
  deals its bonus damage to other creatures, an upgrade resolves after it attaches,
  and an action is never in play, so their icons always all resolve.

- **A card may bar specific bonus-icon kinds from Enhance.** KeyForge has no such
  rule. Vex lets a card carry `WithoutEnhancement(kinds…)` so deck generation
  never lands those bonus-icon kinds on it, while other kinds may still land — for
  a bonus a card would only be weakened by (Effervescent Principle bars Capture).
  Rolled in per card as they are found.

- **The Rule of Six caps every usage of a card name, not just playing and using.**
  KeyForge's Rule of Six counts a name's plays and uses (reap, fight, `Action:`)
  and stops there: it explicitly does **not** apply to repeating an effect or to
  triggering or resolving abilities again (KeyForge Master Rulebook — "the Rule of
  Six only applies to playing or using cards, not triggering (or resolving) their
  effect multiple times"; the Nirbor Flamewing ruling turns on this). Vex
  extends the same six-usage-per-name-per-turn pool to **every** kind of usage:
  each loop of a self-repeating ability past its first, each `Destroyed:`
  resolution, each destruction replacement (Reassembling Automaton), and each
  Replicator-style trigger all draw from the name's pool of six. The "by card
  name, per player" scope matches KeyForge; the extension to repeats, resolutions,
  and triggers is the divergence. It gives every unbounded loop one uniform bound
  and is what lets a 0-power Reassembling Automaton terminate — its replacement
  stops standing in once the name's pool is spent. The pool lives in
  `GameState.UsagesThisTurn` and is summed by name and owner
  ([game_ruleofsix.go](../internal/engine/game_ruleofsix.go)).
