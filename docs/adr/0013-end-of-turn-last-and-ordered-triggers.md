# End-of-turn abilities resolve last, and simultaneous triggers are ordered

## Context

Two resolution-order bugs were found while designing the phase machine (ADR 0012).
Both had test expectations pinning the wrong behavior, so recording why the old
expectations are wrong is a precondition for changing them.

**End-of-turn abilities fired first, not last.** `EndTurn` resolved every
`TriggerEndOfTurn` ability, _then_ readied cards, _then_ drew. An ability that
reads "at the end of your turn" therefore saw a board where nothing had readied
and the hand had not refilled — the state at the end of the play phase, not the
end of the turn.

**Simultaneous triggers fired in board order.** When several abilities triggered
on one event, `triggerAbilities` resolved them in scan order: printed abilities,
then upgrade-granted, then constant-granted, player 0 before player 1. KeyForge
gives the active player the choice of order, which matters whenever one trigger
changes whether another can resolve. Destruction was the sole exception —
`destroyTogether` hand-rolled the player's choice, so the correct behavior existed
but only in one place.

## Decision

**End of turn is the last phase**, resolving after ready and draw (ADR 0012).

**Every multi-source trigger window is ordered by the active player.**
`triggerAbilities` routes through the existing `orderByChoice` helper whenever more
than one ability fires on an event, and `destroyTogether`'s hand-rolled ordering is
replaced by the same call. A single trigger is forced and never prompts; the
default chooser keeps scan order, so ordering only becomes interactive under a real
frontend.

## Consequences

- Existing tests that asserted the old order are wrong and are rewritten to assert
  the new one — not deleted, and not weakened.
- Cards whose end-of-turn ability depended on seeing unreadied creatures change
  behavior. This is the correction, not a regression.
- The ordering prompt is a new interaction point: a frontend that ignores it falls
  back to scan order, which is the previous behavior.
- The game log can state the order a player chose, because there now is one
  (ADR 0011).
- **A window of only identical abilities is auto-ordered, never prompted.**
  Ordering compares ability _identity_ — trigger plus rendered text — not card,
  because the same card can resolve differently as the board changes. When every
  pending ability shares one identity the window resolves the same in any order, so
  it is silent; a single distinct entry makes the whole window ordered in full
  (identical entries included), because resolving one can change what another does.
  See `orderTriggered` in `game_abilities.go`.
- **A frontend may offer Auto-resolve on an ordering prompt.** Whether an order is
  worth arranging is the player's call, not the engine's, so the client's
  `Orderer` implementation adds an Auto-resolve button that answers with a random
  order in one click. The engine is unchanged: the default chooser still keeps
  scan order.
- **A printed `Reap:`/`Fight:`/`Action:`/`Play:` ability orders in the same window
  as the bystander reactions to that action.** Each printed timing ability is
  semantically a reaction to its own event ("after this creature reaps, do …"), so
  a use/play verb gathers the acting card's own printed ability together with every
  bystander "after a creature reaps/is used/fights/is played" reaction into one
  `orderTriggered` pass (`reapReactions`, `fightReactions`, `actionReactions`,
  `playCreatureReactions`, `afterPlayReactions` in `game_abilities.go`), rather than
  firing the printed ability first as a separate step. Every entry is ordered by the
  active player but resolves for its own controller, so a bystander's "after an enemy
  creature reaps: gain Æmber" still credits its owner. Triggering a named ability
  directly (Replicator makes a creature reap) is not performing the action, so it
  resolves the ability alone and opens no window (`TriggerAbilityOf`).
- **Duration reactions order in the same window as the card-sourced set, through
  the flat `ReactionChooser` port.** A "for the remainder of the turn" reaction (Full
  Moon, Charge!, Crystal Hive) lives in the flat lasting registry (ADR 0007) and has
  no in-play source card. Each unified window folds its duration reactions into the
  same `orderTriggered` pass as window entries (`lastingReactions` builds them;
  `resolveWindow` resolves them through `resolveReaction`) rather than resolving them
  in a trailing dispatch of its own. The whole window — card abilities
  and duration reactions alike — is one flat labeled list: `orderTriggered` renders
  each entry as an `OrderableReaction` (a card ability shows its source card and
  rendered text, a duration reaction its rendered effect) and asks the active player,
  through the optional `ReactionChooser` capability, to pick the next reaction to
  resolve, repeating until one remains. A window whose entries are _all_ identical is
  auto-ordered and never prompts, since their order cannot matter; any distinct entry
  makes the whole window ordered in full (identical entries included), because
  resolving one entry can change what another would do. A `Chooser` without
  `ReactionChooser` (the AI, the simulator) keeps the gathered order — the card
  abilities in collection order, then the duration reactions in registry order — so
  folding never reorders the card abilities that already resolved there. The cardtest
  harness (`bridgeChooser.ChooseReaction`, scripted by `Player.Order(cards…)`) and the
  suspendable driver the web client answers through (`suspendChooser.ChooseReaction`,
  which yields a `RequestReaction` the client renders) both implement the port. An event with no card ability of its own (an enemy
  creature destroyed) still gets a window: `afterDestroyedReactions` folds its
  `lastingReactions` into the same ordered list.
- **A destruction _replacement_ is not a Destroyed-window entry.** A replacement
  that stands in for a creature's destruction (Reassembling Automaton's own
  static `Replace`, Armageddon Cloak's attached-Upgrade `Replace`) is not a
  `Destroyed:` ability — it is a static `Replace` on the card definition that
  `filterUndestroyed` applies _before_ the window is enrolled
  (`game_leaves_play.go`). A replacement supersedes the destruction, so a replaced
  creature never enters the orderable Destroyed window at all. Replacement and
  `Destroyed:` abilities therefore never compete for ordering within one window,
  and a creature carrying both a replacement and a granted `Destroyed:` ability
  resolves the replacement first (superseding the event) rather than interleaving
  the two — there is no ordering choice to make.
