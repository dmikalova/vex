# Card wording rules

These are the house wording conventions for printed card text — one surface of the
controlled Rules voice ([ADR 0019](adr/0019-controlled-rules-voice.md); see the
root `AGENTS.md`). Every card's rendered text obeys the conventions below, so the
printed card maps cleanly onto the effect AST (each clause is a node) and can never
desync from behavior.

The conventions were originally derived by diffing a curated implementation set
against the original printed KeyForge text, but they now stand on their own as
house style — they apply to every set, not just the one they were first drawn
from. The pristine printed originals still live in
[callofthearchons.json](../internal/cards/provenance/callofthearchons.json), a flat
JSON array of every Call of the Archons card, for reference.

Some conventions are deliberate **divergences** from KeyForge — a renamed card
type, retired verbs, restructured abilities. Where Vex diverges, Vex wins.
Each divergence is called out inline below and cataloged in the
[Vex⇄KeyForge divergence register](keyforge-divergences.md), which holds the
precedence rule (fall back to the KeyForge Master Rulebook only for what Vex
has not decided).

Matching the printed KeyForge text is never a goal in itself and never a blocker.
Template consistency and simplicity across Vex outrank exact KeyForge wording:
a **meaning-preserving** reword that puts a card in the same voice and template as
the rest of Vex — or that lets a mechanic decompose into shared nodes — is
welcome, and needs no divergence-register entry (the register catalogs changes to
a rule or a name, not house-voice alignment).

The goal of the rewording is **one printed sentence per engine operation**: text
that maps cleanly onto the effect AST (each clause is a node), so the printed
card and the implementation never desync. Each rule below notes the intended AST
shape where relevant.

## 1. Keywords stand alone — reminder text is removed

Parenthetical reminder text is stripped; the keyword is the whole statement.

| Original                                                                                            | Curated     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `Elusive. (The first time this creature is attacked each turn, no damage is dealt.)`                | `Elusive.`  |
| `Skirmish. (When you use this creature to fight, it is dealt no damage in return.)`                 | `Skirmish.` |
| `Taunt. (This creature's neighbors cannot be attacked unless they have taunt.)`                     | `Taunt.`    |
| `Poison. (Any damage dealt by this creature's power during a fight destroys the damaged creature.)` | `Poison.`   |

Reminder text is a rendering concern (a keyword glossary), not part of the
ability tree. Keywords are modeled as flags/ratings on the card, so their meaning
lives in the engine, not the string. Several keywords on one card render as a
single comma-separated sentence — `Skirmish, Poison.`, not `Skirmish. Poison.` —
because they are one list of properties, not a sequence of statements.
(Affected: Drumble, Batdrone, "John Smyth", Bulleteye, Deipno Spymaster, Faygin,
Macis Asp, Dew Faerie, Chuff Ape, Champion Anaphiel, Ancient Bear, Briar
Grubbling, Way of the Bear, Way of the Wolf.)

### Articles in front of a computed noun

Whenever the noun in a phrase comes from a helper — a `Selection`'s `noun()`,
`e.noun()`, a `Target`'s noun form — build the article with `indefinite(noun)`
rather than concatenating `"a " + noun`. The card types include _artifact_ and
_action_, so a hardcoded `"a "` prints "a artifact" the moment someone points an
existing effect at a new type. `indefinite` is in `internal/engine/text.go`
alongside `plural` and `countNoun`, which exist for the same reason on the
number axis: never write `noun + "s"` or a `card(s)` placeholder by hand.

### A card name is a proper name and takes no article

A phrase that names a card by its printed name renders the name bare — "archive
Velum from your discard pile", "shuffle Subtle Chain from your discard pile into
your deck" — never "a Velum" or "a Subtle Chain". KeyForge is split on this
(Hyde prints the bare name, Chain Gang prints the article), so Vex picks the
bare form for all of them: one template means a by-name pick is just a `Named`
selection handed to an existing verb, rather than a verb that owns an article and
therefore has to be its own node. This is phrasing only, so it is not a
divergence-register entry.

### Two wordings that are standardized, not left to the printed card

- **A leading duration clause takes a comma**: "for the remainder of the turn,
  this creature belongs to house Mars". The printed cards are split on this —
  Brain Stem Antenna omits the comma mid-sentence — so we always include it
  rather than making punctuation depend on sentence position.
- **`Damage` casing follows rule 15, not the individual card**: a number of
  damage dealt is always capitalized (`deals 5 Damage`, `deals +2 Damage`), and
  `deals no damage` stays lowercase because no icon is printed there.
- **Capitalize icon/magnitude terms and named keywords; card types are plain
  nouns.** The terms card text capitalizes are the ones backed by a printed
  icon or magnitude — `Æmber`, `Damage`, `Power` — and the named keywords
  (`Skirmish`, `Elusive`, …). Card types are not: `creature`, `artifact`,
  `upgrade`, and `tactic` (and their plurals) read as lowercase common nouns,
  exactly like the generic `card`. A card type is only capitalized when it opens
  a sentence (via the ordinary first-letter capitalization every line already
  gets — "Creatures cannot fight this creature"), never because it is a card
  type. This scope is card text only: the doc-comment `Type:` label, the rulebook
  term headwords (`Creature`, `Artifact`), and prose that discusses the types
  stay capitalized as the proper glossary/label names they are.

## 2. `gains` for everything grantable — retire `gets`

Every acquired stat modifier or keyword uses **`gains`**. `gets` is retired.

| Original                                       | Curated                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Each friendly creature gets +1 power.`        | `Each friendly creature gains +1 power.`      |
| `This creature gets +5 power.`                 | `This creature gains +5 power.`               |
| `Each of Bulwark's neighbors gets +2 armor.`   | `Each of Bulwark's neighbors gains +2 armor.` |
| `This creature gets +1 armor and gains taunt.` | `This creature gains +1 armor and taunt.`     |

A single `gains` covers both numeric modifiers and keywords, so one grant clause
can list both (`gains +1 armor and taunt`). Maps to a `Grant{...}` node whose
payload is a stat delta and/or keyword.

**Punctuation split (unchanged from prior convention):**

- Granting a **stat/keyword**: bare, no quotes — `gains +5 power`, `gains taunt`.
- Granting a **quoted ability**: comma + quotes — `gains, "Destroyed: …"`.

## 3. Self-destruction is `Destroy <self>`, never `Sacrifice`

| Original                                             | Curated                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Omni: Sacrifice Key to Dis. Destroy each creature.` | `Omni: Destroy Key to Dis. Destroy each creature.` |
| `Omni: Sacrifice Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.`  | `Omni: Destroy Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.`  |

`sacrifice` is collapsed into `destroy`; there is one destruction verb.
(Affected: Key to Dis, Combat Pheromones, Gorm of Omm, Epic Quest, Longfused
Mines, Nepenthe Seed.)

## 4. Card movement is `Put X …`, never `Return X …`

| Original                                                            | Curated                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Return an enemy creature to its owner's hand.`                     | `Put an enemy creature into its owner's hand.`               |
| `Return Bad Penny to your hand.`                                    | `Put Bad Penny into your hand.`                              |
| `Return a creature from your discard pile to the top of your deck.` | `Put a creature from your discard pile on top of your deck.` |

One movement verb (`Put`) covers every destination: `into … hand(s)`,
`into … archives`, `on top of … deck`. Maps to a `Move{card, zone}` node.
(Affected: Fear, Arise!, Bad Penny, Faygin, Phoenix Heart, Grasping Vines, World
Tree, Nepenthe Seed.)

The rule reaches the **code**, not just the printed text: an effect node, a
facade alias, a log entry, and a `*Game` method that moves a card all say `Put`
and `Into`, never `Return` and `To`. A name that still says `Return` is how the
old verb creeps back into new card text, so rename it when you touch it —
`PutItIntoHand`, `PutNextTacticIntoHand`, and the mechanic's
own file `internal/engine/effect_put_into_zone.go`.

## 5. Result gates use `->`, replacing `If you do`

A conditional consequence that depends on the previous clause succeeding is
written with an arrow, not a follow-up sentence.

| Original                                                                                        | Curated                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Purge a creature from a discard pile. If you do, put a +1 power counter on Eater of the Dead.` | `Purge a creature from a discard pile -> give Eater of the Dead a +1 power counter.` |
| `Destroy a damaged creature. If you do, steal 1 Æmber.`                                         | `Destroy a damaged creature -> steal 1 Æmber.`                                       |
| `You may sacrifice another friendly creature. If you do, fully heal Chuff Ape.`                 | `You may destroy another friendly creature -> fully heal Chuff Ape.`                 |
| `Lose 1 Æmber. If you do, you may forge a key at current cost.`                                 | `Lose 1 Æmber -> forge a key at current cost.`                                       |

`A -> B` is a **gate**: attempt A, and only run B if A actually happened. Maps to
`Gate{attempt: A, then: B}`. This is distinct from an unconditional sequence
(`A. B.`) and from a state branch (`If <fact>, …`).

A **self-repeat** takes the arrow only when its loop really is gated on the effect
having happened. Bait and Switch's steal stops the moment it moves no Æmber, so it
prints `Steal 1 Æmber -> if your opponent has more Æmber than you, repeat this
effect`. Numquid the Fair repeats on a board fact alone — it comes back while you
are overwhelmed even when a ward absorbs its destroy — so it is two plain
sentences: `Destroy an enemy creature. If you are overwhelmed, repeat this
effect`. The gates are named for the split (`WhileYouDo` and `MayWhileYouDo` print
the arrow, `While` prints the sentence), so the printed text says which loop the
card has.

A gate takes an `otherwise` **only** for a genuine two-way branch — arms that are
**different verbs**, the same carve-out rule 22 grants a state branch. When the
attempt does nothing (the controller declined the optional attempt, or it had no
legal target), the `otherwise` arm runs in its place: `A -> B. Otherwise, C.` Maps
to `Gate{attempt: A, then: B, else: C}`. A number-only difference between the arms
still collapses to `-> B, or D if …` and takes no `otherwise` (rule 22).

| Original                                                                                                                                | Curated                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `You may discard a Logos card. If you do, gain 1 Æmber. Otherwise, destroy Novu Dynamo.`                                                | `discard a Logos card from your hand or archives -> gain 1 Æmber. Otherwise, destroy Novu Dynamo.`                     |
| `You may discard a card from your archives. If you do, keys cost +3 Æmber during your opponent's next turn. Otherwise, archive a card.` | `discard a card from your archives -> keys cost +3 Æmber during your opponent's next turn. Otherwise, archive a card.` |

The optional `you may` is dropped: the `otherwise` arm already carries the choice,
since declining the attempt takes it.

Power counters use the verb `give`: `give <creature> a +1 power counter` (not
`put a +1 power counter on <creature>`). The holder is named — the source by name
for a self-counter (`give Eater of the Dead a +1 power counter`), or `that
creature` when a creature was just chosen.

## 6. Replacement effects front-load `instead`

When an effect replaces what _would_ happen, the `would` cue comes first and
`instead` heads the replacement clause — the twist is never buried at the end.

| Original                                                                                              | Curated                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `…any Æmber you would gain from reaping is stolen from your opponent instead.`                        | `…instead of gaining Æmber from reaping, steal the same amount.`                                |
| `Each Æmber that would be added to your opponent's pool is captured by Ether Spider instead.`         | `If Æmber would be added to your opponent's pool, instead Ether Spider captures it.`            |
| `Destroyed: Fully heal this creature and destroy Armageddon Cloak instead.`                           | `If this creature would be destroyed, instead fully heal it and destroy Armageddon Cloak.`      |
| `Destroyed: If you have any other creatures in play, instead of destroying Reassembling Automaton, …` | `If this creature would be destroyed and there is another friendly creature in play, instead …` |

Two shapes:

- **Passive event:** `If X would …, instead Y` (Ether Spider, Armageddon Cloak).
- **Named action:** `Instead of X, Y` (Dimension Door).

Maps to a `Replace{when, cond, with}` interceptor, distinct from a trigger. Note
Armageddon Cloak drops the `Destroyed:` trigger label — a destruction _save_ is a
replacement, not a post-destruction trigger. An Upgrade carries the `Replace` to
save its host; a creature carries it (in its own `Static`) to save itself
(Reassembling Automaton, Self-Bolstering Automata), reading in its own voice
rather than through the `This creature gains, "…"` framing. A conditional save
folds its condition into the `would` clause (`If this creature would be destroyed
**and** there is another friendly creature in play, instead …`).

Because the replacement stands in _before_ the destruction is enrolled, a saved
creature never counts as destroyed — it does not bump the enemy-creatures-destroyed
tally, the creatures-destroyed-this-way count, or fire "after … destroyed"
reactions. (Authoring a destruction save as a `Destroyed:` trigger — as the Automata
once were — wrongly counted the creature as destroyed; the `Replace` path fixes
that.)

## 7. Self-reference by card name

A creature refers to itself by name, not "this creature" (outside granted
abilities).

| Original                 | Curated                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `Play: Capture 3 Æmber.` | `Play: Charette captures 3 Æmber.` |

The rule by context:

- **On a creature, where the creature is the subject/holder of the effect** — it
  names itself: `Charette captures 3 Æmber`, `Valdr deals +2 Damage …`,
  `fully heal Chuff Ape`. Capture and static modifiers bind to that specific
  creature, so the name carries meaning.
  - **Capture always names its target:** the
    target is now always specified (an unspecified target used to default to the
    source creature), so the capturing creature is stated explicitly rather than
    left implicit.
- **On a creature, for a one-shot action with no lingering attachment to the
  source** — imperative, no name: `Deal 1 Damage to each enemy creature`,
  `Ready and fight with a friendly creature`.
- **On an upgrade or inside a granted quoted ability** — use `this creature` /
  `its`, since the host can vary: `Fully heal this creature`, `Put this creature
into its owner's archives`.

## 8. `Choose one` renders as a bulleted list

| Original                                                                         | Curated                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Choose one: Archive a card, or, for each archived card you have, gain 1 Æmber.` | `Choose one:`<br>`- Archive a card`<br>`- Gain 1 Æmber for each card in your archives.` |
| `Choose one: destroy each Dis creature, or gain 1 Æmber.`                        | `Choose one:`<br>`- Destroy each Dis creature`<br>`- Gain 1 Æmber.`                     |

Each option is a list item; maps to `ChooseOne{options: [...]}`.

## 9. Front-load `for each` / iteration — subject → effect

Counting and iteration clauses lead the sentence, so a card reads **forward**:
the subject (what you count) first, then the effect it drives — the reader never
has to run to the end for the multiplier and jump back.

| Original                                                          | Curated                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Gain 1 Æmber for each forged key your opponent has.`             | `For each forged key your opponent has, gain 1 Æmber.`             |
| `gain 1 Æmber each time you play a creature.`                     | `each time you play a creature, gain 1 Æmber.`                     |
| `Gain 1 Æmber for each creature healed this way.`                 | `For each creature healed this way, gain 1 Æmber.`                 |
| `Deal 1 Damage to a creature for each friendly creature in play.` | `For each friendly creature in play, deal 1 damage to a creature.` |

The loop header precedes the body, matching `ForEach{source, body}`. In the
engine this is the `Count` interface: any effect carrying a `Per Count` renders
it as a leading `for each <CountText>, <body>` clause (via the shared `forEach`
helper), so `GainAember`, `DealDamage`, and every future `Per`-scaled effect
front-load automatically.

## 10. Global effects are granted abilities

A "for every creature" rule is expressed as each creature _gaining_ the ability,
rather than a free-floating static/trigger.

| Original                                                                                                                                                       | Curated                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `When a creature would enter a discard pile from play, it is purged instead.`                                                                                  | `Each creature gains, "Destroyed: purge this creature."`                                                                                                      |
| `Before a creature fights, discard the top card of its controller's deck. If the discarded card is of the active house, exhaust that creature with no effect.` | `Each creature gains, "Before Fight: Discard the top card of its controller's deck. If the discarded card is of the active house, the fight does not occur."` |

Reuses the grant + quoted-ability machinery instead of a bespoke global rule.

## 11. `this way` for back-references

Effects that reference the cards/creatures they just touched use `this way`
(e.g. `discarded this way`, `healed this way`, `destroyed this way`), and
threshold self-checks use `fewer than N … this way`
(Bonkers Killing Machine). This is the standard back-reference idiom.

## 12. Terminology adopted from KeyForge keywords

Longhand descriptions are replaced by the canonical keyword/verb.

| Original                                                                                  | Curated                                                             | Keyword          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `Place 2 Æmber from the common supply on an enemy creature.`                              | `Exalt an enemy creature 2 times.`                                  | Exalt            |
| `This creature gains, "You may use this creature as if it belonged to the active house."` | `This creature gains versatile.`                                    | versatile        |
| `This creature belongs to all houses.`                                                    | `This creature gains versatile.`                                    | versatile        |
| `Omni: Destroy Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.`                                         | `Versatile.`<br>`Action: Destroy Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.` | Omni → versatile |

**Omni → Versatile + `Action:`.** This is the one keyword swap that changes a
card's _structure_, so it is worth spelling out. An `Omni:` ability may be used on
your turn **whether or not the card is in your active house**; a plain `Action:`
ability may only be used when the card **is** in the active house. **Versatile** is
exactly the keyword that lets a card be used as if it belonged to the active house.
So an Omni card is re-expressed as two pieces:

1. the card **gains `Versatile`** (a keyword on the card), and
2. its `Omni:` ability is rewritten verbatim as an `Action:` ability.

For almost every card these two are behaviorally identical — using the card
exhausts it, and the Versatile grant removes the active-house restriction — so the
engine has **no separate Omni trigger**. Author it with
`card.WithKeywords(card.Keyword.Versatile)` plus a `card.WithAbility(card.Trigger.Action, …)`.

Concretely, `Omni: Destroy Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.` becomes:

```text
Versatile.
Action: Destroy Gorm of Omm. Destroy an artifact.
```

(Affected: Key to Dis, Combat Pheromones, Epic Quest, Gorm of Omm, Deipno
Spymaster, Longfused Mines, Nepenthe Seed.)

## 13. Cancellation primitive: `the fight does not occur`

Fight prevention is a terse cancel, not a longhand "exhaust with no effect".

| Original                                 | Curated                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `…exhaust that creature with no effect.` | `…the fight does not occur.` |

Maps to a `CancelFight` result; relies on the creature already being exhausted at
use-time.

## 14. Renames

| Original name         | Curated name            |

## 15. `damage` is always lowercase

Damage is a **common noun**, not a proper one: it is lowercase everywhere, in
every context — dealing it, healing it, or referring to it.

```text
Deal 3 damage to each creature.
Heal 3 damage from a creature.
Bruiser deals 5 damage when fighting.
Valdr deals +2 damage while attacking an enemy creature on the flank.
```

Printed KeyForge cards capitalize the word where a damage **icon** appears, but
an icon is a layout device, not a spelling: Vex renders card text as prose,
so it takes the prose casing. This is a house-voice choice, not a rule change —
it alters no card's behavior and is not a
[divergence](keyforge-divergences.md).

`Æmber` keeps its capital for the opposite reason: it is the proper name of a
resource, not a common noun.

**The renderer enforces this.** Every amount of damage in card text is rendered
by `damageAmount` in `internal/engine/text_helpers.go`, so a new effect cannot
drift back to a capital by formatting its own `"%d Damage"`. Route new damage
text through that helper.

## 16. Spelling, qualifiers, and referents

- **`Æmber`** — never `Aember`. The engine renders the resource as `Æmber`
  everywhere (card text, log, rulebook), so that is the one spelling in
  player-facing prose. Go identifiers keep the ASCII `Aember` by convention:
  `Æ` is a legal Go identifier rune (a Unicode uppercase letter), so `Æmber`
  would compile, but ASCII keeps identifiers typeable and greppable. This rule
  governs text, not code.
- **`<Trait>` references read like house references** — a trait filter names the
  trait as a plain adjective on the noun (`Scientist creature`, `Knight
creature`), exactly as houses do (`Mars creature`,`Sanctum creature`). Neither
  carries a `trait` qualifier.
- **`during their next turn`** — not `on their next turn`.
- **`the chosen creature`** — the standard referent for a creature just chosen
  (`Choose a creature. … the chosen creature`).
- **`it` names a card, `this` names an event.** `it` is reserved for the card in
  context, so a clause whose subject is an event says `this` instead: Æmber
  Conduction Unit reads `if this is the first time a creature has reaped this
turn`, not`if it is …`. Without the split a card that gates on both reads
  `if it is an enemy creature, if it is the first time …`, where the two `it`s
  look like one referent.

## 17. Name the source zone for card-movement effects

Effects that move a card between zones name the zone explicitly, so the text is
unambiguous about _where from_.

| Original          | Curated                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Archive a card.` | `Archive a card from your hand.` |

Applies to archiving (`from your hand`, `the top card of your deck`) and any
future zone-to-zone movement (hand, deck, discard, archives). `Archive` alone
never implies the hand.

The same holds for the Æmber **pool** a capture draws from: a capture always
names it, even where the printed card leaves it implied.

| Original                               | Curated                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a friendly creature captures 1 Æmber` | `a friendly creature captures 1 Æmber from your opponent` |

**Play is the one source zone that takes no possessive.** Every other zone is a
player's copy of it ("your hand", "your opponent's discard pile"), but play
belongs to neither player, so it renders as the bare `from play`. The side scope
then rides on the **object** instead of on the zone — `friendly` or `enemy`
before the noun — so nothing is lost by dropping the determiner.

| Original                                         | Curated                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Shuffle each card from in play into your deck.` | `Shuffle each friendly card from play into your deck.` |

## 18. Æmber a player owes another player is `give`, never `pay`

One verb covers Æmber changing hands between players: **`give`**. `pay` (the
printed wording on toll cards) is retired so every player-to-player transfer reads
the same way, matching Interdimensional Graft's "they must give you their
remaining Æmber".

| Original                                                           | Curated                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Your opponent must pay you 1 Æmber in order to play an artifact.` | `In order to play an artifact, your opponent must give you 1 Æmber.` |
| `…they must pay you their remaining Æmber.`                        | `…they must give you their remaining Æmber.`                         |

The engine keeps the mechanic named `Toll` (the thing a card charges), but its
rendered text says `give`. (Affected: Customs Office, Tentacus,
Interdimensional Graft.)

An `in order to` requirement states the requirement **up front**: `In order to do
X, you must do Y` — the price comes after the thing it gates, so the reader learns
what is restricted before what it costs, rather than having to backtrack. This
applies to every toll (`In order to use an artifact, your opponent must give you 1
Æmber.`) and to a play cost (`In order to play Truebaru, you must lose 3 Æmber.`).

## 19. The `action` card type is renamed `Tactic`

KeyForge overloads "Action": it is both a **card type** (a one-shot card you play
from hand) and an **ability** (`Action:` on a ready creature or artifact). To keep
the two distinct, the card **type** is renamed **`Tactic`** (rendered `Type:
Tactic`), while the **`Action:` ability** keeps its printed wording untouched.

| Context                        | Wording          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Card type (was "action")       | `Tactic`         |
| Ability on a creature/artifact | `Action:` (kept) |

This is a naming choice, not a text rewrite: the `Action:` prefix on every card's
ability line is unchanged.

## 20. One-time house reassignment, not `while under your control`

A few cards take control of a card and then say it belongs to a house for as long
as you control it — e.g. Sneklifter's printed _"Take control of an enemy artifact.
While under your control, if it does not belong to one of your three houses, it is
considered to be of house Shadows."_ The `while under your control` clause is
**dropped** in favor of a one-time reassignment, **evaluated once, when the effect resolves**:

> Take control of an enemy artifact. If it does not belong to a house on your
> identity then it belongs to house Shadows.

The continuous "while under your control" form needs a kind of dynamic memory that
re-checks the card's houses every time control changes; the one-time form does not.
It is also **slightly more interesting**: the reassignment sticks with the card
(until it leaves play), so if an opponent later takes it back they can be stuck
with a card of a house they may not have. "A house on your identity" is one of the
controller's three deck houses. (Affected: Sneklifter.)

## 21. A deferred play permission becomes an immediate play

Several cards grant a play that may be taken any time later in the turn — e.g.
Phase Shift's printed _"Play: You may play one non-Logos card this turn."_ The
`this turn` window is **dropped** and the play happens **immediately, as part of
resolving the card**:

> Play: Play a non-Logos card.

The deferred form needs turn-scoped memory of an unused permission — a counter
that must be armed, spent by an unrelated later play, and cleared at end of turn —
plus a prompt on every subsequent play asking which allowance to spend. The
immediate form needs none of that: the effect resolves, the player picks a card
from hand, and it is played there and then.

The general rule: **`... you may play an X card this turn` renders as `Play an X
card`.** Both`you may`and`this turn` go — a play with no legal card in hand
simply does nothing, so the permission needs no explicit opt-out. The rule extends
to a grant that may be spent on **playing or using** a card. Taber's _"You may
play or use a non-Star Alliance card this turn"_ becomes:

> Fight/Reap: Play or use a non-Star Alliance card.

The play-or-use resolves now against the cards in hand and in play. (Affected:
Phase Shift, both Kirbys, Taber.)

## 22. A number-only branch collapses to `or <alt> if <cond>`

A two-armed `If <cond>, <A>. Otherwise, <B>.` whose arms are the **same verb**
differing only in a number is a disguised parameter, not a real fork. It collapses
to one verb that states the base value and appends the exception as a trailing
rider — a linear sentence read in order, with no branch.

| Original                                                                                                                | Curated                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `If your opponent has 7 Æmber or more, steal 2 Æmber. Otherwise, steal 1 Æmber.`                                        | `Steal 1 Æmber, or 2 if your opponent has 7 Æmber or more.`                  |
| `If your opponent has no Æmber, forge a key at +2 Æmber current cost. Otherwise, forge a key at +6 Æmber current cost.` | `Forge a key at +6 Æmber current cost, or +2 if your opponent has no Æmber.` |

The base value is the one that applies when the condition is **absent**; the rider
names the value the condition switches to. Maps to a single effect node whose
amount carries an `OrAmount{Amount, When}` — the alternate value and its guard —
which renders the `, or <alt> if <cond>` tail and picks the value at resolve time.
No `Else` arm exists.

`Otherwise` survives only for a genuine two-way branch — arms that are **different
actions**, not the same verb with a different number. Vespilon Theorist keeps it
(archive the revealed card and gain 1 Æmber, or discard it), because archive and
discard are different actions on different zones. (Affected: Ronnie Wristclocks,
Key of Darkness.)

## 23. "That creature and each creature that shares a trait" folds into the trait sweep

A card that chooses a creature and then destroys "that creature **and** each
creature that shares a trait with it" names the chosen creature twice: once as the
subject and again, implicitly, in the trait sweep — a creature always shares a
trait with itself. The curated text drops the redundant "that creature and" and
states only the sweep, so `ChooseCreatureThen{Then: Destroy{... .SharingTrait()}}`
renders `choose a creature - destroy each creature that shares a trait with it`.
The chosen creature is still destroyed, because it matches its own trait filter.

| Original                                                                                  | Curated                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Choose a creature. Destroy that creature and each creature that shares a trait with it.` | `Choose a creature - destroy each creature that shares a trait with it.` |

(Affected: Extinction.)

---

## 24. "Do X. If <cond>, do Y instead" becomes a choose-then conditional

A card that names a default action on a creature and then overrides it with an
exception ("Stun an enemy creature. If that creature was already stunned, destroy
it instead.") is authored as a `ChooseCreatureThen` whose `Then` is a
`Conditional`: the exception is the `Then` branch and the default is the `Else`.
The curated text therefore leads with the choice and the condition rather than the
default action, because the condition must be read against the creature's state
_before_ the default would change it — stunning first would make "already stunned"
always true.

| Original                                                                            | Curated                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Stun an enemy creature. If that creature was already stunned, destroy it instead.` | `Choose an enemy creature - if that creature was already stunned, destroy it. Otherwise, stun it.` |

(Affected: 1-2 Punch.)

---

## 25. A trailing `if <cond>` condition moves to the front

A card that states an effect and then qualifies it with a trailing condition
("Gain 3A if you control creatures from 3 different houses.") is authored as a
`Conditional`, which always renders the condition first. The curated text leads
with `If <cond>, <effect>` so every gated effect reads the same way, matching the
condition-leading form KeyForge already uses elsewhere.

| Original                                                    | Curated                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Gain 3A if you control creatures from 3 different houses.` | `If you control creatures from 3 different houses, gain 3 Æmber.` |

(Affected: Prince Derric, Unifier.)

---

## 26. Use-conditions read from the controller, and an upgrade names its host

A card that may not be used until its controller has met a condition is authored
as a `Restrictions.UseCondition`. On a creature or artifact it renders `You
cannot use this card unless <condition>.`; on an upgrade — where "this card" is
the upgrade, not the thing being used — the subject becomes the host creature:
`This creature cannot be used unless <condition>.` The condition itself always
reads from the controller's point of view (`you have discarded a card from your
hand this turn`), replacing KeyForge's third-person`its controller has
discarded a card this turn`.

| Original (upgrade)                                                                   | Curated                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `This creature cannot be used unless its controller has discarded a card this turn.` | `This creature cannot be used unless you have discarded a card from your hand this turn.` |

(Affected: Earthbind. Giant Sloth is the creature form.)

---

## 27. "Gain that much Æmber" becomes `Resolve the bonus icons on it`

A card that destroys, purges, or discards a card and then acts on its Æmber bonus
is authored as the removal (`Destroy`, `PurgeCreature`, …) followed by a
`ResolveBonusIcons{Target: Triggering}`, which resolves _every_ bonus icon printed
on that card — Æmber, capture, draw, and damage alike — reading the removed card in
context (`it`). This deliberately diverges from KeyForge, which only refunds the
Æmber bonus: resolving the whole icon strip is a small power increase and lets the
mechanic reuse the shared bonus-icon resolver instead of a one-off Æmber count (see
the [Vex⇄KeyForge divergence register](keyforge-divergences.md)). The rendered
form names what is being resolved, so behavior and text cannot drift.

| Original                                                                              | Curated                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Destroy an artifact. If that artifact had an Æmber bonus, you gain that much Æmber.` | `Destroy an artifact. Resolve the bonus icons on it.` |

(Affected: Rustgnawer.)

---

## 28. A turn `step` is named a `phase`

A named part of the turn is a **phase**, never a **step** — Vex has one word
for a segment of the turn ([ADR 0012](adr/0012-first-class-turn-phases.md) makes
the turn phases first-class). Card and rules text that refers to the `"forge a
key"`or`"draw cards"`part of the turn writes`phase`, where KeyForge writes
`step`.

| Original                                | Curated                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `During your "draw cards" step, …`      | `During your "draw cards" phase, …`      |
| `skips the "forge a key" step during …` | `skips the "forge a key" phase during …` |
| `You skip your "forge a key" step.`     | `You skip your "forge a key" phase.`     |

(Affected: Miasma. The end-of-turn hand-size cards — Streke, Mother, Succubus,
The Howling Pit — formerly used the `"draw cards" phase` wording but now state the
new size directly through the hand-size template of § 33.)

---

## 29. Fight timing is named `in a fight with`

The moment a fight exchanges power damage between two combatants is written as
`in a fight with <creature>`, Vex's one phrase for that timing window.
KeyForge names it several ways — `fighting`, `while fighting`, `during a fight` —
and Vex collapses them to one, so a trigger that fires on the destruction of
the other combatant reads the same on every card.

| Original                                          | Curated                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `After a creature is destroyed fighting Krump, …` | `After a creature is destroyed in a fight with Krump, …` |

(Affected: Krump.)

---

## 30. A count cap is dropped — no `(to a maximum of N)` clause

A `for each` count that KeyForge caps prints the cap in parentheses — `gain 1
Æmber (to a maximum of 6) for each house …`. Vex drops the cap entirely: the
count is uncapped and the clause is not rendered, so the "for each" sentence
reads clean. This is a deliberate rules divergence, not just a wording change
(see `keyforge-divergences.md`).

| Original                                                                             | Curated                                                          |

| `steal 1 Æmber for each house represented among enemy creatures (to a maximum of 3)` | `steal 1 Æmber for each house represented among enemy creatures` |

(Affected: Free Markets, Forging an Alliance, Trust No One, and the reprints
that share their text.)

---

## 31. "Deal X, deal Y instead if …" is a choose-then-conditional

A card that deals one amount of damage to a chosen creature and a larger amount
instead when that creature meets a condition is authored as a `ChooseCreatureThen`
whose `Then` is a `Conditional` — the condition picks which amount is dealt —
rather than a bespoke damage-boost strategy on `DealDamage`. Compound conditions
compose (`Or{ItIsOfTrait{…}, HasAember{}}`) instead of baking each combination
into a one-off condition, and the rendered form names both amounts and the branch
plainly.

| Original                                                                                              | Curated                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Deal 2 damage to a creature. Deal 6 damage instead if it is a Dinosaur creature or has Æmber on it.` | `Choose a creature - if it is a Dinosaur creature or it has Æmber on it, deal 6 damage to it. Otherwise, deal 2 damage to it.` |

(Affected: Guji Dinosaur Hunter.)

---

## 32. Timed "cannot use" restrictions share one phrasing

A timed effect that bars a player from acting is one `Restrict` node —
`cannot use creatures to fight`, `cannot use creatures to reap`, or the broadest
`cannot use any cards` — and every form ends with the same duration phrase:
`during <their/your> next turn` (OpponentNextTurn) or `for the remainder of the
turn` (RemainderOfPlayerTurn). KeyForge writes the broad current-turn form as "You
cannot use cards this turn"; Vex harmonizes it to "you cannot use **any** cards
**for the remainder of the turn**" so the noun ("any cards") matches the
next-turn form and the duration matches the reap and play bars.

A house scope narrows the reaping noun the same way, so a house-limited reap bar
reads in the shared voice rather than a subject-first sentence of its own. KeyForge
writes Seismo-entangler as "During your opponent's next turn, creatures of the
chosen house cannot be used to reap"; Vex harmonizes it to "your opponent
cannot use **creatures of the chosen house** to reap during their next turn".

| Original                                                                                  | Curated                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `You cannot use cards this turn.`                                                         | `You cannot use any cards for the remainder of the turn.`                                |
| `During your opponent's next turn, creatures of the chosen house cannot be used to reap.` | `Your opponent cannot use creatures of the chosen house to reap during their next turn.` |

(Affected: United Action, Seismo-entangler.)

---

## 33. Hand-size changes read `your hand size is N more/less`

A card that continuously changes a player's end-of-turn hand size states the new
size directly, rather than KeyForge's `refill your hand to N additional cards`
during the `"draw cards"` phase. The subject names whose hand — `your hand size`,
`your opponent's hand size`, or `each player's hand size` — the verb is always
`is`, and the magnitude is `N more` or `N less`:

- `Your hand size is 1 more.` (Mother)
- `Your opponent's hand size is 1 less.` (Succubus)
- `Each player's hand size is 1 more.` (The Howling Pit)

A per-count scale prefixes `For each <count>`: `For each friendly Sin creature
your hand size is 1 more.` (Greed). A flank/center restriction prefixes
`While <self> is …,`: `While Streke is not on a flank, your opponent's hand size
is 1 less.`(Streke);`While Zenzizenzizenzic is in the center of the battleline,
your hand size is 2 more.` (Zenzizenzizenzic).

This is a phrasing reword — the effect, a continuous end-of-turn hand-size
modifier, is unchanged — so it carries no divergence-register entry.

---

## 34. A change until its card leaves play omits `until it leaves play`

A targeted effect that lasts until its creature or artifact leaves play does not
say so: every targeted effect already ends when its subject leaves play, so the
clause would only restate the default. Borrow reads `Take control of an enemy
artifact. It belongs to house Shadows.`, not`… until it leaves play`. (Affected:
Borrow, Sneklifter, Boosted B4-RRY, Lord Invidius.)

---

## 35. "Shares a house with `<the card in context>`" becomes `of that card's house`

A target narrowed to the house of the card a preceding effect put in focus —
KeyForge's "a creature that shares a house with the destroyed creature" — is
rendered `a friendly creature of that card's house`. The contextual-house matcher
reads the house of the card in context (`ctx.It`), so the referent is whichever
card the sentence before it named, and the shorter phrase keeps every such target
on one template. Essence Scale reads `Choose a friendly creature - destroy the
chosen creature. Ready and use a friendly creature of that card's house.`
(Affected: Essence Scale.)

---

## 36. No parentheses in card text

Card text never uses parentheses. A parenthetical is an aside, and the Rules
voice has no asides: every clause is either an instruction the player carries out
or a qualifier on one, so it belongs in the sentence. A qualifier that trails the
clause it narrows takes a comma; one that applies to several clauses is stated
once at the end rather than repeated per clause.

## 37. A sentence names a card once, then refers back to it

Within one sentence, a card named a second time becomes `it`. Restating the noun
reads as a new subject and makes the reader check whether a second card is meant.
Where the repeated noun is the subject of a conjoined verb phrase, it is dropped
outright rather than replaced.

| Original                                                                                | Curated                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `If this is the first time this creature has been used this turn, ready this creature.` | `If this is the first time this creature has been used this turn, ready it.` |
| `Move 1 Æmber from this creature to the creature this creature fights.`                 | `Move 1 Æmber from this creature to the creature it fights.`                 |
| `take control of it, and that creature belongs to house Shadows`                        | `take control of it, and it belongs to house Shadows`                        |
| `This creature belongs to Logos and this creature gains "Reap: Draw a card."`           | `This creature belongs to Logos and gains "Reap: Draw a card."`              |

Three mentions stay spelled out. A **possessive** does, because `it` carries no
case and would attach to the nearest preceding noun — Pain Reaction's
`deal 2 damage to each of that creature's neighbors` would read as the damage's
neighbors. A mention in a **later sentence** does, since the pronoun's antecedent
does not carry across a full stop. And a mention inside a **quoted granted
ability** does, because the quoted ability is its own text and may not borrow the
granting card's subject: `This creature gains, "Reap: Ward this creature."`

A **card's own name** is never collapsed, even repeated in one sentence. It is
often preceded by another creature, so
`After a creature is destroyed in a fight with Chonkers, give it +1 power counters`
would hand `it` to the creature that was destroyed.

The renderer applies this, so a card definition never spells it out: see
`collapseRepeatedSubject` in `internal/engine/text_helpers.go`, pinned by
`TestCollapsesRepeatedSubject`.

## 38. A reference to the fought creature takes its trigger's tense

`Fight:` resolves after the fight, so it names `the creature <self> fought`.
`Before Fight:` resolves before the fight, so the same reference reads
`the creature <self> fights` — the past tense would claim a fight that has not
happened.

| Trigger         | Curated                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Fight:`        | `Stun the creature Roxador fought.`                          |
| `Before Fight:` | `Move 1 Æmber from this creature to the creature it fights.` |

The renderer applies this too: `fightTense` in `internal/engine/text.go`, pinned
by `TestBeforeFightTargetReadsInPresentTense`.

## Deliberate rule changes (not just wording)

A few cards diverge from KeyForge in ways that affect the rules, not just
phrasing. Those changes, and the precedence rule that governs every divergence,
live in the [Vex⇄KeyForge divergence register](keyforge-divergences.md).
