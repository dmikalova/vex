// Package card is a small, ergonomic facade over the game engine for *authoring*
// cards. Card-set packages import this package (as `card`) so definitions read
// like card.New(...), card.House.Brobnar, card.DealDamage{...} without referring to the
// engine's package name directly.
//
// Almost everything here is a re-export — type aliases (which are fully
// interchangeable with the engine's types) and constant/function values — of
// identifiers in package engine, shaping the authoring API. The one bit of logic
// is the card registry (see register.go): New builds a card and enrolls it in
// the database, so a set package declares each card as `var X = card.New(...)`
// — one line, no init, no central list.
