// a layer above the board, with the card's own verbs under it.
//
// The real card never moves. A copy is laid out over the slot it was lifted from
// and grown from there, so deciding what to do with a card costs the board no
// reflow and the card stays readable while its buttons are up — which is the point
// of putting them on the card rather than in a dock the player has to look away to.
//
// The copy is grown by resizing, not by scaling the board card as a picture: the
// reason to enlarge a card is to read the text the board was clipping, and only a
// real box reflows it. So only its width is set; the height is whatever its rules
// (a stack of upgrades, say) come out at, with a floor of focusMinGrow and a
// ceiling of what the window has left.
