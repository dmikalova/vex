// Package web is the browser client for the Vex card game. It renders an
// interactive two-player hotseat match on the Vex engine,
// compiled to WebAssembly via the go-app framework: the playtester sees
// the whole board and drives both sides.
//
// The package also carries its own browser-scenario suite at /ui-test (uitest.go,
// uitest_scenarios.go), switched on by an environment variable the same way the
// style gallery is. A scenario is a journey of several steps clicked through the
// real DOM and ending in a state change a player would describe — "deal,
// mulligan, choose a house, play a creature, undo it" — never a single-widget
// assertion, which stays a host test in client_test.go. The host tests are the
// fast fine-grained gate; the browser suite is the coarse proof that the whole
// client is wired up in a real browser.
