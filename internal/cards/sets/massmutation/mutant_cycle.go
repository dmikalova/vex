// The mutant cycle. Mass Mutation's mutants are house hybrids: each creature
// carries a house prefix and a house suffix, and its stats and abilities are the
// sum of the two houses' contributions. The suffix house owns the creature — it
// is the creature's house and lends its creature trait — while the prefix is any
// other house. Rather than hand-write all 42 printed combinations, this file
// models each house's fixed contribution once (mutantHouses) and composes every
// mutant from a prefix and a suffix (mutantOptions), registering the 42 that Mass
// Mutation prints (mutantProvenance).
//
// Every house — even Brobnar and Mars, which Mass Mutation never prints as a
// mutant — defines a full contribution, so a later set that mutates them has the
// data ready. TestMutantHousesComplete enforces that promise: a house added to
// the game without its mutant data fails the build.

// mutantHouse is one house's fixed contribution to a mutant creature: the name
// fragments it lends in the prefix and suffix positions, the creature trait its
// suffix stamps, the power and armor it adds, and the keywords and abilities it
// grants. A mutant's power and armor are the sum of its two houses' values; its
// keywords and abilities are their union; its trait and owning house come from
// the suffix alone.
