// Package sim plays whole random, legal Vex games to shake out engine bugs
// that per-card unit tests never reach — a card leaking Æmber, a move-between-
// zones path that duplicates or drops a card, a turn that corrupts the flat state.
// Every game is decoded from a byte script and checked against the engine's own
// invariants (engine.Game.InvariantError) after each step.
//
// One Simulate function backs all three entry points in sim_test.go: the
// coverage-guided FuzzPlay fuzz target, a fixed-seed property test wired into
// `mage ci:test`, and the long-running `mage soak`. Because a game is a pure function
// of its script, any failure is a deterministic input that replays exactly and can
// be promoted to a unit test.
//
// This package lives outside internal/engine on purpose: it drives the engine
// through its public API and the real card database (via internal/match), and the
// engine's 100% coverage gate applies only to engine, not here.
