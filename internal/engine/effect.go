// This file and its effect_*.go / target.go siblings make up the card effect
// "AST": the small tree of nodes that both prints a card's rules text and
// carries it out. Each node type lives with related nodes in a file grouped by
// mechanic (effect_aember.go, effect_stun.go, ...), and every type's doc comment
// explains the mechanic in rulebook terms before the code shows how it is
// modelled. They all live in package engine because effects reach deep into the
// engine (dealing damage, destroying, drawing, choosing creatures); splitting
// them into a separate package would force the whole engine to be exported.

// Effect is one node in a card's effect tree. Each node knows how to render
// itself to English (Text) and how to carry itself out against a live game
// (Resolve). Because the same node does both, a card's printed rules text can
// never drift from what the card actually does.
