// control), Trait scopes a use grant to a creature trait instead of a house
// (Mutagenic Serum's "use friendly Mutant creatures"), Grant selects the verbs it
// frees (play, use, or fight), Types narrows the card types (the zero value frees
// all), and Cards bounds how many cards the grant frees (zero is unlimited). The
