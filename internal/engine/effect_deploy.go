// This file holds the Deploy keyword: a creature with Deploy may enter play at any
// position in its controller's battleline, not only on a flank. playCreatureCard
// in game_play.go calls deployPosition to place the creature.

// deployPosition decides where a creature entering a battleline lands. On an empty
// line there is one position and nothing to ask. When canDeploy is set and the
// creature has Deploy, its controller chooses any of the line's positions — the
// left flank, the right flank, or between any two creatures — so it can enter
// mid-line; interior reports a between-two-creatures landing, which the log
// narrates differently. Otherwise the creature lands on a flank: the flank fl
// names when the play dictated one, or the flank the active player is prompted for
// when fl is flankUnset. The engine never assumes a flank — an effect that puts a
// creature into play without naming a side always asks (ADR 0010's invalid-zero
// discipline, applied to placement).
//
// Every position is measured against the line as it stands *after* the chooser
// answers, never the line the prompt was drawn from. Asking crosses a resolution
// boundary that settles destroyed creatures (ADR 0029), so a line of two can be a
// line of one by the time the answer arrives, and the right flank the prompt
// offered is then one slot past the end
// (TestDeployPositionMeasuresTheLineAfterThePrompt).
