// Revealing cards shows them from a hand to both players and records them in the
// log, turning hidden information public. A card reveals cards so that what
// follows can be trusted — you reveal the Mars cards you are drawing for, or an
// opponent's whole hand before discarding from it — which is why the printed text
// is careful about which cards are shown.
//
// A narrowing Filter reveals only the cards it admits (the wording "reveal any
// number of Mars cards"): the player picks which of them to show, one at a time,
// until they are done — "any number" includes none. The zero Filter reveals the
// whole hand, which is not a choice.
