// GAINING A TEXT BOX lets a creature take on another card's printed text box: its
// traits, its keywords, and its triggered abilities, resolved as if printed on the
// gaining creature. It does not copy the source's name, power, armor, type, house,
// or other stats — only the text box. Mimic Gel copies a chosen creature until
// Mimic Gel leaves play; Creed of Nurture lends a hand creature's text box to a
// creature in play for the remainder of the turn.
//
// A gained ability resolves with its Source set to the gaining creature, so any
// self-referential text ("destroy this creature", "{self} gains…") now refers to
// the creature that gained the text, matching the KeyForge rule that a copied or
// gained text box rebinds its own references. The source's text box is read from
// the immutable card catalog, so it stays available even after the source card
// leaves play — and it is the source's PRINTED text box, never a text box the
// source itself gained, so gaining never chains.
//
// Because the game state is a flat, pointerless value, a gain is stored as the
// source's LocalID+1 on the gaining creature's CardCore: TextBoxSourcePlus lasts
// until the creature leaves play (resetCore clears it) and TextBoxTurnSourcePlus
// lasts the turn (the end of the turn clears it). Traits, keywords, and triggered
// abilities each fold the gained sources in at their read seam — HasTrait,
// hasKeyword, and triggeredBy. Constant abilities and numeric combat keywords
// (Assault N, Hazardous N) are not yet part of a gained text box; add them at
// those read seams when a card needs them.

// grantedTextBoxSources returns the cards whose printed text box creature id has
// gained — its permanent copy (Mimic Gel) and its remainder-of-turn loan (Creed
// of Nurture). Each is stored as a LocalID+1, so 0 means none.
