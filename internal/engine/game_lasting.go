// This file holds LASTING EFFECTS: "for the remainder of the turn" effects that
// attach to a later game event. Three flavors share the same flat registry:
//
//   - a REACTION runs after an event (Full Moon gains Æmber after you play a
//     creature, Charge! deals damage after you play a creature, Crystal Hive gains
//     Æmber after a creature reaps). Reactions fold into the event's trigger window
//     through lastingReactions, so they order together with the card abilities that
//     fire on the same event when several fire at once (ADR 0013).
//   - a REPLACEMENT changes an event's own outcome before it happens (Dimension
//     Door makes reaping steal Æmber instead of gaining it). The event site queries
//     for a replacement (lastingReplacement) and applies it in place.
//   - a MODIFIER adjusts an event's amount rather than swapping its outcome (Lethal
//     Distraction makes a chosen creature take additional damage whenever it takes
//     damage). Like a replacement it is queried at the event site, but the matches
//     are summed (lastingExtraDamage) so modifiers stack, and it is subject-scoped
//     to the one creature it names.
//
// Because the game state is a flat, pointerless value it cannot hold effect
// closures, so a lasting effect is a small enum-tagged record (LastingEffect)
// resolved by a central switch. Adding a new one is a new Event and/or
// lastingAction plus a case here — never a bespoke branch in the play/reap path.

// Event names a moment a lasting effect attaches to.

	// stun (a reaction point). Legion's March attaches here. It is a superset of
	// EventReap and EventFight, which fire only for their own use kind.

	// intercepts the incoming gain, so the pool's owner keeps the Æmber they already
	// have.
	EventAemberAddedToPool
	// EventAemberTakenFromPool is Æmber about to be taken from a player's pool by a
	// steal or capture (a replacement point). A card that redirects the take's source

	// the Æmber from the common supply instead so the pool's owner keeps what they

	EventForgeKey
	// EventCardEntersPlay fires after the controller plays a card that stays in play

	// window "the next creature/artifact you play" effects arm, so they can reach an
	// artifact too, which EventCreaturePlayed cannot.
	EventCardEntersPlay
	// EventCardPlayed fires after the controller plays a card of any type, including
	// one that never enters play (a reaction point). Library Access attaches here,
	// excepting itself so it draws only for another card.
	EventCardPlayed
	// EventCreatureTakesDamage is an amount of damage about to land on a creature (a
	// modifier point, always subject-scoped). Lethal Distraction attaches a "this
	// creature takes an additional N damage whenever it takes damage" modifier to one
	// chosen creature; applyRawDamage queries the registry and sums the bonuses.
	EventCreatureTakesDamage
	// EventBeforeFight fires just before a creature is used to fight, keyed to the
	// attacker and always subject-scoped. Unlike the other reaction points it is fired
	// by fireLastingBeforeFight, which matches on the subject alone rather than the
	// acting player, so a grant that lasts into the opponent's turn (Diplomacy's "each
	// creature gains 'Before Fight: Exalt this creature'") fires for an enemy attacker
	// on the opponent's turn too.
	EventBeforeFight
