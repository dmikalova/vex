// stored as this tag and rebuilt into its Effect by scheduledEffectOf when its
// window fires.

// It is exported because it appears in TurnResolver's signatures and in
// ScheduledEffect.Do, both exported: an unexported parameter type would make
// Resolver implementable only from inside this package, which the narration
// audit's decorator (internal/engine/narrationaudit) is not. Its values stay
// unexported — a caller outside the engine names the type, never a tag.
