// Markdown generator, the /rulebook page, and the /glossary page: RuleBook groups
// the terms into ordered sections, and Glossary flattens the same registry into an
// alphabetical Title→Definition list. Because all three surfaces draw from here,
// the ordering, headings, and term set cannot drift between them.
