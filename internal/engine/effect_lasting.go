// This file holds the authoring effects for lasting "for the remainder of the

// event), Instead installs a replacement (change an event's own outcome). Both are
// thin: they translate a composed effect into a flat lasting record via AddLasting
// (see game_lasting.go for how the records are fired and queried).

// ForRemainderOfTurn installs a reaction that runs for the rest of the controller's
// turn each time On occurs — Full Moon (gain Æmber when you play a creature),
// Charge! (deal damage when you play a creature), Crystal Hive (gain Æmber after a
// creature reaps), Library Access (draw a card each time you play another card).
// Do is the effect that runs each time; the supported effects are GainAember
// (crediting the controller), DealDamage to an enemy creature, CaptureAember,
// GiveAember, and Draw. The card that installs the reaction never triggers it
// itself, so an event phrased as "another card" excludes the play that armed it.
