// SwapCards exchanges two cards' places. When both sit in the same battleline,

// places across zones: the resting card enters play in the in-play card's slot,
// and the in-play card leaves to that discard pile (swapAcrossZones). A pair the
// swap cannot place — two creatures on opposite battlelines, or two resting cards
// — is left where it is.
