// RuleTerm is one entry in the rulebook: a self-describing rule co-located with
// the code it governs. The engine owns the terms as typed data (ADR 0018) so the
// rulebook generator renders them instead of re-parsing Go source, and the
// completeness test can fail the build when a closed catalog — every Keyword,
// card type, or trigger — has a member no term describes.
type RuleTerm struct {
	// Section files the term under one part of the rulebook spine; its value is
	// the section key the renderer groups by (see the Section constants).
	Section Section
	// Title is the term's heading, e.g. "Capture Æmber". Terms that share a Title
	// render under one heading, so several code sites can feed one entry.
	Title string
	// Subtitle, when set, groups the term beneath its Title as a subheading, e.g.
	// the numbered steps under "Turn structure".
	Subtitle string
	// Definition is the one-line, Rules-voice gloss that doubles as the glossary
	// entry. It is optional for now; the glossary that surfaces it is future work.
	Definition string
	// Body is the term's Markdown prose, rendered verbatim under its heading.
	Body string

// constant values are the section keys the renderer buckets by.
