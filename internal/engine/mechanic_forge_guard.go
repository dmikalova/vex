// beforeForgePrevented fires the before-forge trigger window for the non-forging
// player's in-play cards — their "when your opponent would forge a key" abilities
// (Keyforgery) — then reports whether one of them cancelled forger's imminent key
// forge. The window runs before any Æmber leaves the pool, so a cancelled forge
// costs the forger nothing. The veto is a transient flag CancelForge sets and this
// reads and clears, mirroring FightCancelled.
