			Definition: "The turn runs through eight phases in a fixed order: start of turn, " +
				"forge a key, choose a house, archives, the main phase, ready, and draw, " +
				"then end of turn.",
			Body: `The turn opens here. Abilities that trigger "at the start of your turn" resolve
now, before you forge, so an ability that changes what a key costs or adjusts your
Æmber acts before the forge phase reads it. You order your own start-of-turn
abilities when more than one triggers.`,

			Subtitle:   "opening hand and mulligan",
			Definition: "Each player's starting hand: the first player draws 7 cards, the second draws 6, and each may mulligan once for one card fewer.",
			Body: `To set up, one player is chosen to take the first turn. That first player draws a
starting hand of 7 cards; the other player draws 6. Then each player, starting
with the first, may mulligan once: shuffle their whole hand back into their deck
and draw a new hand of one card fewer — 6 for the first player, 5 for the second.
A player who mulligans keeps the new hand. Chains cut the opening draw the same way
they cut any draw, and a mulligan sheds no further chain.`,

			Subtitle:   "the first player's first turn",
			Definition: "On the first player's first turn, they may play or discard only one card from their hand.",
			Body: `On the first player's first turn only, that player may play or discard just one
card from their hand of their own volition — one or the other, not both. Using
creatures to reap, fight, or take an "Action:" is unaffected. A card effect can let
them play more: a card another card plays for them (Wild Wormhole, Phase Shift)
does not count against the limit, and a grant to play a card (Subject Kirby,
Captain Val Jericho) lets them play that card too. Only a bare in-house play of
their own volition counts against the one-card allowance.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseForge.rulebookStep(),
			Body: `You forge a single key if you can pay its cost — 6 Æmber by default — spending
that Æmber. You forge at most one key per turn, and an effect can raise the cost
or make you skip the phase. Keys are the win condition: forge your third key and
you win the game.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseChooseHouse.rulebookStep(),
			Body: `You pick one of your deck's three houses as your active house for the turn. For
the rest of the turn you may play from hand and use only cards of that house,
except cards that ignore the restriction such as Versatile ones.`,
		},
		{
			Section:    SectionTurn,
			Title:      "Active House",
			Definition: "The house a player chooses for their turn; they may play and use only cards of that house.",
			Body: `The house a player picks in the choose-a-house phase is their active house for
that turn. They may play cards from hand and use cards in play only of that
house, except where a card frees them from the restriction. A player may pick
any house of their deck, and also any house they control a card of in play.

An ability can watch which house was picked — "After you choose Dis as your
active house, ..." — and an ability can read that no card in play, on either
side, belongs to the house just picked.

An effect can also change the active house for the rest of the turn. The new
house takes over at once, so the player may play and use that house's cards from
then on; the house they picked no longer frees anything.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseArchives.rulebookStep(),
			Body: `With a house chosen, you are offered your archived cards. You may take all of
them into your hand at once — archived cards are set aside face-down on earlier
turns, out of your opponent's reach. You are not prompted when your archives are
empty.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhasePlay.rulebookStep(),
			Body: `The open phase, where you take your turn. In any order you may play cards from
your hand, discard from your hand, and use your ready cards of the active house: a
creature reaps for Æmber, fights an enemy creature, or takes an "Action:" ability,
and an artifact takes its "Action:". Combat happens here — fighting is one way of
using a creature. You stay in the main phase until you end your turn.`,

			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseReady.rulebookStep(),

upright. Cards that entered play exhausted this turn ready here too. Readying is
all this phase does: the turn's own temporary effects are still in force, and
expire at the end of turn.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseDraw.rulebookStep(),

Chains cut your draw: you draw one fewer card for every 6 chains you hold, and
shed a single chain only on a turn the reduction actually kept you from a card.`,

			Section:  SectionTurn,
			Title:    "Turn structure",
			Subtitle: PhaseEndOfTurn.rulebookStep(),
			Body: `The turn closes here. Abilities that trigger "at the end of your turn" resolve
now, last of all, so they see the board and hand the turn actually ends with. You
order your own end-of-turn abilities when more than one triggers.

An effect that lasts "for the remainder of the turn" expires after those abilities
have resolved, so an end-of-turn ability still sees it in force. Each creature's
armor refreshes to full at the same point. Play then passes to your opponent.`,
