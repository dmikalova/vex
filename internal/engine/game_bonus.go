// resolveBonusIcons resolves a played card's printed bonus icons, one at a time,
// top to bottom, before its "Play:" abilities. Each icon's source is the card
// itself.
//
// An armed one-shot boost (Wild Bounty) is consumed here, on the next card its
// owner plays, and makes each icon resolve an additional time — interleaved, so an
// icon resolves and then immediately resolves again before the next icon, rather
// than in a second full pass. Each resolution independently rechecks the
// leaves-play and prevention gates, so a boost re-resolution that would land after
// the creature left play, or after a bar arrives, is skipped like a first one.
//
// Two deliberate divergences from KeyForge: the source of each icon's effect is
// the card carrying it (KeyForge treats the game as the source), and if the
// creature leaves play before or during resolution the remaining icons do not
// resolve (KeyForge resolves them all once the card is played). Only a creature
// is in play as its icons resolve — an artifact deals its bonus damage to other
// creatures, an upgrade resolves before it attaches, and an action is never in
// play — so the leaves-play check applies to creatures alone.
