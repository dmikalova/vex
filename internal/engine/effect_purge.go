// Purging a card sets it aside out of the game entirely, in the purge pile, where
// no ability can reach it unless that ability names the purge pile. It is the most
// permanent way a card leaves play: a purged card never enters a discard pile and
// can never be drawn, played, or destroyed again.
// PurgeCard sets cards aside out of the game, taken from the resting piles a
// player holds. Zones names which — a hand, a discard pile, archives, or several
// pooled together — and Player whose: Controller or Opponent for one named side
// (Imperial Traitor purges from your opponent's hand), ChosenPlayer for a
// side the controller picks among those holding a matching card (Creeping
// Oblivion's "a discard pile"), EachPlayer for both at once (Soldiers to
// Flowers). A Selection decides which cards leave — a chosen card, restricted by
// house or type; a uniformly random one (Impspector); or every match (Lesser
// Oxtet). Quantity purges that many per zone — Takes a fixed or board-scaled
// number, UpTo that many so the controller may stop early (Creeping Oblivion's
// "up to 2"), or AnyNumber (Destructive Analysis). GainOwnerAember gives each
// purged card's owner 1 Æmber.
// It serves both as a standalone effect (Creeping Oblivion purges up to 2 cards)
// and as the first half of a Then ("purge a creature -> give a +1 power counter"),
// so it reports whether it purged anything, and it records the tally and the total
// Æmber bonus of the purged cards so a following effect can scale with them
// (Noname's power, Infurnace's Æmber loss).
//
// The purge verb is three nodes, and the split is settled — do not merge them
// from their names. PurgeCard draws from resting piles with a Selection;
// PurgeCreature selects from play with a Target, which is a different selection
// vocabulary, not a different source zone; PurgeArchivedCardThen's purge is a
// cost gate rather than a selection at all. Merging any two produces a node whose
// fields are only valid in particular combinations.
