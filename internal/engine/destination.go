// Destination names where an effect puts a card it moves, and renders the
// KeyForge phrase for it — "into its owner's hand", "on top of its owner's deck",
// "into your archives". It is a zone plus whose copy of that zone: by the
// ownership rule only your battleline, artifact line, and archives may hold an
// enemy card, so Yours is meaningful on the archives alone. The deck has three
// separate destinations (its top, its bottom, and shuffled in), so "the deck"
// alone is never a destination; a card always names which.
// Play is deliberately not a Destination, so PutIntoPlay stays outside this
// matrix. Two reasons, and the second is the structural one: entering play runs a
// lifecycle (flank choice, exhaustion, armor, the enters-play window every
// AfterCreatureEnters card watches) where every arm here runs at most the
// leave-play teardown; and the matrix exists because the SOURCE zone decides the
// call, while putIntoPlay is source-agnostic — it calls removeFromAnyZone itself,
// so play would be a column with one row. Folding it in would buy no sharing and
// cost the matrix its one property, that it only moves cards between piles.
