// TurnStat names one of the tallies the engine keeps about what a player did
// during a turn, so a card can ask "did your opponent forge a key on their
// previous turn?" or "how many enemy creatures died fighting this turn?" without
// the engine keeping a replayable log of the game. The tallies themselves live in
// GameState.TurnHistory, which is indexed by these values; a new question about a
// turn is one more constant here plus the one place that bumps it.

	// KeysForgedThisTurn counts the keys the player has forged during the current

	// KeysForgedLastTurn counts the keys the player forged during their own previous
	// turn — Tendrils of Pain, Key Hammer.
	KeysForgedLastTurn
	// CreaturesPlayedLastTurn counts the creatures the player played during their own
	// previous turn — Lifeweb.
	CreaturesPlayedLastTurn
	// EnemyCreaturesFightKilled counts the player's enemies destroyed in a fight this
	// turn — The Warchest. It is the only tally kept from the watching player's side
	// rather than the acting player's, because that is the side the card pays.
	EnemyCreaturesFightKilled
	// EnemyCreaturesDestroyed counts the player's enemy creatures destroyed by any
	// means this turn — Foozle. Like EnemyCreaturesFightKilled it is kept from the
	// watching player's side, but it counts every destruction, not only fights.
	EnemyCreaturesDestroyed
	// FriendlyCreaturesDestroyed counts the player's own creatures destroyed by any
	// means this turn — Bonesaw enters play ready if a friendly creature has died. It
	// is kept from the destroyed creature's controller side, the mirror of
	// EnemyCreaturesDestroyed.
	FriendlyCreaturesDestroyed
	// CreaturesReapedThisTurn counts the creatures the player has reaped with during
	// the current turn — Aember Conduction Unit stuns the first enemy creature to
	// reap. It is kept from the reaping (active) player's side.
	CreaturesReapedThisTurn
	// CreaturesFoughtThisTurn counts the creatures the player has used to fight during
	// the current turn — Alaka enters play ready once you have fought. It is kept from
	// the attacking (active) player's side.
	CreaturesFoughtThisTurn
	// CreaturesUsedThisTurn counts every creature the player has used this turn by any
	// means — reaping, fighting, or using an Action ability — the umbrella "used"
	// tally Sloth reads to reward a turn with no creature use. It is kept from the
	// using (active) player's side and, unlike the reap/fight tallies, is reset at
	// StartTurn rather than in the end-of-turn cleanup, so it reads as "this turn"
	// for the whole of the turn that follows the one it counted.
	CreaturesUsedThisTurn
	// AemberStolenFromThisTurn counts the Æmber stolen from the player during the
	// current turn — kept from the victim's side so a card can ask whether they were
	// robbed. It rolls into AemberStolenFromLastTurn at the end of the thief's turn.
	AemberStolenFromThisTurn
	// AemberStolenFromLastTurn counts the Æmber stolen from the player during their
	// opponent's previous turn — Information Exchange steals more if they were robbed.
	AemberStolenFromLastTurn
	// turnStatCount sizes GameState.TurnHistory and is not a tally itself.
