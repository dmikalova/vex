// AN ALSO-TRIGGERS-ON rule makes a creature's abilities under one trigger also
// fire on another — its play effect fires again on reap (Kompsos Haruspex), or its
// fight and reap effects each fire on the other (Livia the Elder). Nothing about
// the ability changes; only the moment it fires does. Two sources feed the one
// gather seam in game_abilities.go:
//
//   - a friendly ConstantAbility in play, through ConstantAbility.AlsoTriggers,
//     active only while its source stays in play (Kompsos Haruspex).
//   - an active lasting rule, installed by FuseTriggersForTurn for the remainder
//     of the controller's turn (Livia the Elder).
//
// Because the game state is a flat, pointerless value, a lasting rule is a small
// comparable record (LastingAlsoTriggersOn) held in a fixed array, mirroring the
// lasting reaction registry in game_lasting.go.

// occurs. Kompsos Haruspex carries {From: Play, Onto: Reap}: a friendly creature's
// play effect fires again when it reaps.
