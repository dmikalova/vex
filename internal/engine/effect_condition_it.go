// ItIs is met when the card in context (ctx.It — a just-played, revealed, or
// discarded card) is a card its Filter admits, e.g. "if it is a Mars creature"
// (Brain Stem Antenna reacting to a played card), "if it is an artifact" (Carlo
// Phantom), "if it is a Giant creature" (Stilt-Kin), "if it is Subtle Chain"
// (Chain Gang), or "if it is of the chosen house" (Chaos Portal).
//
// A Filter is a test of one card, which is exactly what this condition is, so the
// whole "it is a …" family is this one node: a trait, a name, a house and a type
// are axes of the shared narrowing vocabulary rather than four conditions. The
// House matcher stays the one house-filter vocabulary (ADR 0038): a named house, a
// non-<house> ("if it is a non-Star Alliance card" — Book of leQ), or a referenced
// house (the chosen or active house). The zero Filter admits any card.
