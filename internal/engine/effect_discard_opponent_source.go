// DiscardFromOpponent discards one card from a source the controller picks among
// Sources — Fidgit offers the opponent's facedown archives (a uniformly random
// card) and the top of their deck — and binds the discarded card as ctx.It so a
// following effect can react to it (Fidgit plays it when it is a Tactic). Sources
// reads each Zone the way PlayFromOpponent does: Archives is a random facedown
// card, Deck is the top card. One source discards from it with no prompt; several
// offer the choice. An empty chosen source discards nothing and binds nothing.
//
// DiscardCard does not cover this even with Player: Opponent. Its Zones combine
// into one pool of cards the selection picks a card out of, which a facedown pile
// and a deck cannot join; here the choice is the pile itself, and the card falls
// out of it. Folding the two would give DiscardCard a second, mutually exclusive
// meaning for Zones.
