# Engine design guide

`internal/engine` is the pure game engine. It imports nothing upward (see the
dependency layering in the root `AGENTS.md`) and is the one package held to 100%
test coverage (`mage ci:cover`). This document is the **design ideal** for the
engine: the patterns it is built from, where each belongs, and the deliberate
tradeoffs — including the ones that look like smells but are forced by a
constraint, and how to handle them so the next mechanic still lands cleanly.

Read this alongside [docs/style-guide.md](../../docs/style-guide.md) ("Composition
and design") and the file-organization rules in the root `AGENTS.md`. This guide is
the _why_; those are the _what goes where_.

## Two hard constraints shape everything

Almost every non-obvious choice in the engine traces back to one of these. When
something looks un-idiomatic, check it against these before "fixing" it. Both are
recorded as ADRs — read them for the full rationale and the rejected alternatives.

1. **Flat, pointerless, comparable state** (ADR 0005). `GameState` is a value
   struct of fixed arrays (`[maxCards]CardCore`, `[2]Zone`) — no pointers, slices,
   or maps — so `GameState.FastCopy()` is a plain value copy for MCTS cloning. What
   that forces in day-to-day work:
   - State cannot hold a closure or `Effect`; "do X later" is flat, enum-tagged
     data (the lasting registry, ADR 0007), not a stored `func`.
   - Values compared against state (notably `Target`, `== Target{}` in
     `ConstantAbility`) stay comparable: a wide flag struct, not a `[]filter`;
     paired `x int` + `hasX bool`, not `*int`.
   - Cards are `LocalID uint8` indices into a read-only `catalog` shared across
     clones.

2. **Effects touch the game only through the `Resolver` port** (ADR 0008). An
   `Effect` holds a `Resolver` via `EffectContext`, never `*Game` or `GameState`;
   the port is the complete, auditable catalogue of card-facing capability (Ports &
   Adapters: the effect AST is the domain, `Resolver` the port, `*Game` the
   adapter).

## Patterns in use (and where each belongs)

- **Interpreter — the effect AST (`Effect`)** (ADR 0006). Every node has `Text()`
  (renders English) and `Resolve(ctx)` (carries it out); one value drives both, so
  printed card text can never desync from behavior. A new mechanic is almost always
  a new `Effect` node in `effect_<mechanic>.go`, not a new branch in the `Game`
  runtime. **A brand-new `Effect` node — or a new `card` facade type — is gated
  behind a full grill-me session (the `grilling` skill) that the human signs off
  on, whether or not you came through the `implement-cards` skill.** Extending the
  engine in composable ways needs no ceremony (a new field, `Strategy`, `Target`
  filter, or `Count` on an existing node is the normal way it grows); but a new
  node widens the shared vocabulary permanently, and cramming a mechanic into an
  existing node in a way that is not clean and composable is the same smell. Both
  must be argued for, not slipped in: stop and present the grill (why it is
  necessary, the cluster of real cards that need it, the alternatives rejected, and
  a before/after authoring comparison). If the grill does not clearly land in
  favour of the new node, extend an existing one instead. When a vocabulary file grows unwieldy (the `Condition` and `Count`
  families each ran past a thousand lines), split it by category into
  `<prefix>_*.go` files that keep the family prefix — `effect_condition.go` keeps
  the framework (the interface, `Comparison`, `Conditional`, `Or`, `CountIs`) and
  its conditions move to `effect_condition_board.go` / `_source.go` / `_it.go` /
  `_turn.go`; `effect_count.go` splits the same way (`_board.go` / `_turn.go` /
  `_produced.go`). A bare concept file splits without the `effect_` prefix but
  still keeps its own top-level prefix so an `ls` groups the family together:
  `target.go` → `target_refinement.go` (the `Refinement` strategies) + `target_select.go`
  (the selection machinery); `resolver.go` → `resolver_game.go` (the `*Game`
  implementation of the port, kept apart from the interface declarations);
  `text.go` → `text_helpers.go` (the card-agnostic string helpers, kept apart from
  the card-shaped renderers).
- **Composite — `Sequence`, `Conditional`, `ChooseHouseThen`,
  `Repeat`, …** compose child `Effect`s and recurse `validateEffect` into them.
  Prefer composing small nodes over one fused node (root `AGENTS.md`: "decompose
  fused effects"). `Sequence` is the only ordered composite: it breaks its
  children into their own sentences by default ("A. B."), and derives the
  exceptions — a run of folding children conjoins into one instruction ("destroy
  a creature and an artifact"), and a `Conditional` gate keeps its own consequence
  joined so the gate visibly covers every clause. There is no per-child sentence
  wrapper and no second list node to choose between; how a card reads follows from
  its effects, not from which composite the author picked.
- **Strategy — the `Chooser` family, and the `Refinement` / `Count` / `Condition`
  trio.** See the next section; this is used heavily and should keep being the
  first tool reached for when behavior varies along an axis.
- **Ports & Adapters — `Resolver`** (ADR 0008). See constraint 2 and the
  segregation section.
- **Facade — the `internal/card` package** wraps the engine for authoring so card
  files never import `engine`.
- **Null Object / invalid-zero** (ADR 0010). `FirstChooser` is the default
  strategy; `playerUnset` / `targetUnset` / `durationUnset` / `eventUnset`
  sentinels make an omitted required field an error caught at card-init
  `validate()` rather than a silent default.

## Strategy: use it, and keep the text with the behavior

Strategy is the engine's second backbone after Interpreter. The mature form here
is a strategy that carries **both** its behavior and its printed-text fragment, so
it plugs into the AST without desync:

- **`Chooser` (`game.go`) is the decision strategy**, swapped per frontend:
  `FirstChooser` (bot/tests, deterministic), `suspendChooser` (interactive play:
  it yields a `Request` instead of computing an answer, which is what the web
  client answers through), `bridgeChooser` (test harness). The engine never knows _how_ a decision
  is made. Extend a chooser's capability with an **optional capability
  interface** discovered by type assertion — `OptionChooser`, `Orderer` — with a
  graceful fallback when unimplemented. That is the idiomatic-Go form of Strategy
  (cf. `io.WriterTo`, `http.Flusher`); prefer it over widening the base `Chooser`.
- **`Refinement` (`target.go`)** is a set-relative refinement (`refine` + `clause`)
  such as `MostPowerful` (or `Except(MostPowerful)`). It narrows the ids _and_
  contributes a phrase, so niche "compare candidates to each other" rules compose
  onto any `Target` **without a field per rule**. When you are tempted to add
  another `Target` bool for a whole-set rule, add a `Refinement` instead.
- **`Count` and `Condition`** are pluggable value/predicate strategies, each with
  paired text (`CountText` / `CondText`). A number that scales with the board is a
  `Count`, not a bespoke effect; a branch is a `Condition` fed to `Conditional`.
- **`CreatureVerb`** is a per-creature verb strategy for `OnChooseCreature`.
- **`RepeatGate` (`effect_repeat.go`)** is the strategy a `Repeat` varies along:
  `While` (repeat automatically while a `Condition` holds), `MayWhile` (repeat at
  the controller's choice while a `Condition` holds), and `ByExalting` (repeat once,
  paid by exalting a creature). Each gate carries both its loop and its trailing
  "repeat" clause, so a new repeat shape is a new gate, not a new node.

Rule of thumb: when behavior varies along an axis, model the axis as a small
strategy interface that also renders its own text — not a new `Effect`/`Target`
field or a `bool`.

## The `Stepper` suspends an action, and contains what it breaks on

`Stepper` (`suspend.go`) is the interactive path of ADR 0040: it runs one action
on a goroutine with `suspendChooser` installed for both players, `Start` yields
the first `Request`, and `Advance(cmd)` answers the current one and yields the
next. `internal/session` drives it; the web client drives the session and holds
no `Chooser` of its own (ADR 0047).

Two rules about how an action ends, and neither is optional:

- **A panic inside the action does not escape.** The goroutine recovers **before**
  closing `requests`, never after: a panic that unwound past the close would leave
  every later `Start`/`Advance` blocked forever on a channel nobody will send to
  or close, and under wasm it would take the whole program down
  (`TestStepperContainsAPanickingAction`). The recovered value and the stack taken
  **at recover time** become a `*PanicError` — the stack has to be captured inside
  the deferred recover or the panicking frames are already gone.
- **`Err()` says why the action stopped.** `Start` and `Advance` report only that
  the action is **done**; the caller then asks `Err()` whether it finished or
  broke. That is the iterator convention Go already uses for a loop that can fail
  (`bufio.Scanner`'s `Scan`/`Err`, `sql.Rows`' `Next`/`Err`) — do not widen
  `Start`/`Advance` to return an error instead.

`Close()` releases an action still parked at a decision, so a `Stepper` abandoned
mid-action — an undo or a replay that deals a fresh game — leaks neither the
goroutine nor the `Game` it captured. It is idempotent
(`TestStepperCloseReleasesGoroutine`).

## Reused effect shapes get one shared helper, not a copy per effect

Effects recur in **shapes** — the same little field cluster and the same logic to
turn it into a value, a phrase, or a validation error — across unrelated
mechanics. When a shape shows up in a third effect, factor its logic into one
helper the effects share; each effect keeps its own authoring fields (so the card
API stays ergonomic), but not its own copy of the behavior. The shapes factored so
far:

- **Scale by a `Per` count.** A magnitude that reads "N for each ..." is a base
  times a `Per Count`. `scaled(base, per, ctx)` (`effect_count.go`) is the value
  companion to `forEach`'s text — `Draw`, `GainAember`, `DealDamage`,
  `AddPowerCounter`, `CaptureAember`, and the economy amounts all scale through it.
  `Per` means the same thing on every effect: multiply one target's amount. The
  distinct "re-run choosing a fresh target" axis is `Times` (`Repeat.Times`,
  `CaptureAember.Times`), never an overloaded `Per`.
- **Amount, or an alternative magnitude.** Many effects offer a fixed `Amount`
  or one other way to say the same size — a `By` pool share, an `All`/`Fully`
  whole-quantity flag. `errAmountOr(name, alt, amount, altSet)` (`effect.go`) is
  the shared "set one, not both" validation, beside the `errUnset*` helpers.
- **How much Æmber against a pool.** `StealAember`, `LoseAember`, `CaptureAember`
  (and, minus the share, `GainAember`) express the amount as a fixed base scaled by
  `Per`, or a `By Loss` share (`Half`, `AllBut(n)`, `AllAember`). The economy
  helpers in `effect_aember.go` — `poolAmount(base, by, per, ctx, pool)` for the
  value (uncapped; the caller `min`s against the pool and records the capped
  figure) and `aemberObject(amount, by, possessive)` for the printed object — carry
  that. A `bool` like Capture's `All` is `By: AllAember` internally; keep the
  authoring `bool` only where the printed wording genuinely differs ("captures
  **all** your opponent's Æmber" has no "from" clause).
- **Count what the previous effect produced.** A "for each ... this way" magnitude
  is a `Count` reading a tally the prior effect left on `ctx.Produced` —
  `CreaturesHealed`, `DamageHealed`, `CardsDestroyed`. A new such tally is a field
  on `Produced` plus a small `Count`, never a bespoke fused effect. A tally about a
  card that _leaves play_ during the effect must be measured **just before** the
  card is removed, so a modifier it carried still counts and a ward that keeps it in
  play does not: `Destroy.destroy` snapshots each creature's board `Power` before
  `DestroyEachFrom` and adds it to `Produced.DestroyedPower` only for creatures that
  actually left, which `PowerDestroyedThisWay` reads (Might Makes Right forges when
  the creatures it destroyed totalled 25 board power). A `Count` used only by a
  `CountIs` threshold still implements `CountText` for the `Count` interface even
  though only its `CountClause` renders.
- **Move a card between zones.** Archive, Discard, Purge, Shuffle, and Put are one
  mechanism — a source zone, a selection strategy (chosen / any-number / all /
  random / top-N, with house/type/name/trait filters), a destination, and the
  optional `ctx.It`/`ctx.Produced` side effects — with each KeyForge verb a thin
  authoring struct that fixes the destination and delegates to it (ADR 0031). It
  is the largest instance of this rule, and the target the Archive/Discard/Purge/
  Shuffle/Put families fold into as their cards are touched: a new zone-movement
  effect adds a selection filter or a destination, never a new bespoke type. The
  mechanism stays unexported — authors write the verb the card prints, not a
  generic `Move`.
- **Move a card that could be in several zones to one destination.** A verb that
  gathers a player's cards across a _set_ of source zones (play, hand, discard,
  deck) and sends the picked card to one destination — Faygin (`ReturnNamedToHand`:
  play/discard -> hand), the search tutors (`SearchForName`: deck/discard -> hand),
  Song of Spring
  (`ShuffleIntoDeck`: play/hand/discard -> deck) — shares one
  internal mechanism, `crossZoneMover{Player, Dest, Sources}` (`effect_cross_zone.go`).
  It gathers with a `keep` predicate (`gather`) and dispatches each picked card
  through the per-`(origin, Dest)` move that reaches the destination from the zone
  the card actually sits in (`move`/`originOf`). The **destination is passed
  explicitly**; a mover never infers it from where the card sat. Each verb stays a
  thin node keeping its own printed text, filter (`Named` vs creature/house), prompt,
  reveal, and `All`/gate specifics — only the "which move lands zone X in zone Y"
  matrix is shared. This is the general shape of the rule below it.
- **Pick any number of cards one at a time.** "Destroy any number of ...", "purge
  any number of ...", "keep N ..." all gather the controller's picks from a
  shrinking pool one prompt at a time. That loop is one helper —
  `pickCards(ctx, prompt, limit, optional, avail)` (`target_select.go`): `limit <= 0`
  is unbounded, `optional` makes each prompt declinable, and `avail` is re-read each
  round so a pool that shifts as cards leave stays current. An effect that spends or
  keeps a variable number of cards calls it and acts on the returned slice (Obsidian
  Forge, Destructive Analysis, Unnatural Selection, Tertiate); it does not re-roll
  the pick-until-decline loop.
- **Redistribute a resource among a side's creatures.** Equalize (Æmber) and
  Entropic Manipulator (damage) both drain a resource off a set of creatures into
  a pool, then hand the pool back one unit at a time onto a chooser-picked creature
  (falling back to the first). That inner loop is one helper —
  `placeAmong(ctx, creatures, prompt, pool, place)` (`effect_redistribute.go`). The
  two effects keep **separate nodes** (`RedistributeCapturedAember`,
  `RedistributeDamage`), because everything around the shared loop diverges: the
  drain (Æmber vs damage accessors), the side selection (a `Side` field vs a
  runtime player prompt), the accept gate (damage only), and the lethal follow-up
  pass (damage only). Merging them into one `Resource`-switched node would be a
  branchy blob switching inside `Resolve`, not one mechanic — do **not** collapse
  the two nodes; share only the loop.

Prefer a shared **helper** over a shared embeddable value type. Now that `Per`
means one thing everywhere, `{Amount, By, Per}` genuinely is uniform across
`StealAember`/`LoseAember`/`CaptureAember` (and `{Amount, Per}` in `GainAember`,
which has no pool to take a share of), so a `Quantity{Amount, By, Per}` would fit.
It still does not pay off. Go composite literals do not promote embedded fields, and
the `card` facade aliases these structs (`card.StealAember = engine.StealAember`),
so a `Quantity` would turn every flat authoring site — `{Amount: 2, Per: X}` — into a
nested `{Quantity: Quantity{Amount: 2, Per: X}}` across ~120 card call sites plus
their tests, buying nothing the helpers above do not already carry. Factor the
logic, keep the fields.

## `Resolver` is segregated into role interfaces — add to the right role

The port and its rationale are ADR 0008. In practice it is composed from focused
role interfaces, not one flat list:

`StateReader` (reads) · `EconomyResolver` (Æmber/keys/chains) ·
`CreatureResolver` (per-card in-play state) · `CombatResolver` (damage,
destruction, ability-driven fight/reap/action) · `ZoneResolver` (card movement
between zones + draw) · `TurnResolver` (turn-scoped grants + the lasting
registry) · `ChoiceResolver` (ordering + choosing) · `Logger`.

**When adding a mechanic that needs a new engine capability**, add the method to
the role interface it belongs to (and implement it on `*Game`). Do not append to a
flat list. If a new method fits no existing role, that is a signal a new role —
and probably a new area of the game — is emerging: add a small role interface and
embed it in `Resolver`.

## New whole-tree operations: a type-switch "Visitor", not a new AST method

`Text()` and `Resolve()` are **intrinsic** to a card's identity, so they live on
each `Effect` node. An operation that is **not** part of a card's identity — an
MCTS/AI value estimate, a static analysis like "does this effect ever target the
opponent", serialization — should **not** become a third method on every node.
Adding it that way forces touching ~40 types for a concern cards do not care
about.

Instead, write a standalone function that type-switches over `Effect` in one
file (the Go-idiomatic Visitor):

```go
// aiValue estimates the board value of an effect for the search AI. It is an
// extrinsic operation over the effect AST, kept out of the Effect interface so
// the card vocabulary stays about identity, not heuristics.
func aiValue(e Effect) int {
    switch e := e.(type) {
    case GainAember:
        return e.Amount
    case DealDamage:
        return e.Amount // ...
    default:
        return 0
    }
}
```

`lastingActionOf` in `effect_lasting.go` is already this shape — a centralized
type switch that maps effects to a flat action. Follow it. The tradeoff (a type
switch is not exhaustively checked by the compiler) is handled by keeping each
such operation in **one** file next to a comment listing which effects it covers,
and by the 100% coverage gate forcing every branch to be exercised.

## The lasting registry is the flat-state interpreter

"For the remainder of the turn" behavior (Full Moon, Charge!, Crystal Hive,
Dimension Door) is a second, deliberately smaller interpreter, because flat state
cannot store an `Effect` closure — the decision and its rationale are ADR 0007.
State holds flat `LastingEffect{On Event, Do lastingAction, Controller, Amount}`
records; `lastingActionOf` maps a composed effect to an enum tag and
`game_lasting.go` fires/queries them. A **reaction** runs after an event: every
site that fires the event folds its reactions into that event's trigger window with
`lastingReactions` (ordered together with the card abilities through the flat
`ReactionChooser` port, ADR 0013) — even an event with no card ability of its own,
like an enemy creature destroyed, still gets a window (`afterDestroyedReactions`
folds `EventEnemyCreatureDestroyed` reactions in). A **replacement** changes an
event's outcome (`lastingReplacement` + `Instead{Of, With}`).

To add one: a reaction on an existing event = support its `Do` in `lastingActionOf`
and `resolveReaction`; a new event = an `Event` value, one `lastingReactions`
(folded into that event's window) or `lastingReplacement` call at the site, and
its `clause`/`gerund` text. You never restructure the play/reap hot path. Keep the
enum dispatch centralized.

**Modifying pending damage is a replacement, not a reaction.** "Whenever a
creature takes damage, it takes an additional N" (Lethal Distraction) reads as a
reaction, but a reaction deals the extra as a _second_ hit after the fact. The
direction is to model it as a replacement on a "damage about to be dealt" event
that takes the pending amount and increases it, so the extra lands as part of the
same damage — extending the `Replacement`/`Instead` vocabulary and retiring the
bespoke `TakesExtraDamage` effect (ADR 0031; not yet built).

**Æmber flow is replaced on either endpoint — source or destination.** When Æmber
moves, a continuous `Replaces` on a card can swap either end. The **destination**
is `EventAemberAddedToPool` — Ether Spider captures Æmber before it lands in a
pool. The **source** is `EventAemberTakenFromPool` — Po's Pixies draws a steal or
capture from the common supply instead of the pool. Both ride the one
`Instead{Of, With, Player}` a card carries in `CardDefinition.Replaces`, read (not
resolved) by a scanner scoped to the watched pool: `aemberCaptorFor` on the
destination, `AemberTakenFromSupply` on the source. A new redirect of where taken
or added Æmber comes from or goes to is a `Replaces` on the matching event plus a
member on the `Replacement` enum — never a bespoke `CardDefinition` bool. Each
scanner returns the **card it found**, not just a bool, because every replaced
outcome is narrated in one voice that names the cause (`replacementLine` in
`log_replacement.go`): `<cause> has <actor> <outcome>, instead of <displaced>`. A
new replacement routes its log line through that seam rather than wording its own.

## Forward house choice is one delayed constraint table

Cards that reach forward to a player's **next house choice** — Control the Weak and
Snag (must a house), Tezmal and Snag's Mirror (cannot a house), Snaglet (a wager on
the house) — do **not** each grow a paired state slot and resolver method. They all
arm entries in one flat table, `State.HouseConstraints[player]` /
`HouseConstraintCount` for this turn and `…Next` for the pending one, the same
fixed-cap-array-plus-count shape as the lasting registry (ADR 0005; `maxHouseConstraints`).
`StartTurn` promotes the starting player's `…Next` entries and clears them, the one
lifecycle all four cards share (ADR 0035).

A `HouseConstraint` is a comparable enum-tagged record (`Kind`: must-house,
must-creature, cannot-house, or wager). `ChooseHouse` resolves the **whole table at
choice time** through `allowedHouses`: start from `choosableHouses` (identity houses
plus the houses of cards the player controls in play in their own right, read now —
a controlled off-house creature widens the choice), remove every cannot (cannot
overrides must), and if any must survives, restrict to the surviving musts. A
must-creature entry stores a `LocalID` and reads that creature's house **now**, so
Snag respects house changes between the fight and the choice — never freeze a house
at arm time. Empty allowed set = **no active house** (a valid outcome, chosen
explicitly as No House). Wagers are scanned by `resolveHouseWagers` at the same
choice and pay their predictor when the chosen house matches.

Two reads, kept separate on purpose: `AllowedHouses` (the widened choosable-minus-
cannot set) drives the choice and the client's picker; `PlayerHasHouse` stays
**identity-only** because `ItIsOffIdentity` (Sneklifter) means "on the identity
card", and a controlled off-house card must not make a creature count as in-identity.
A new forward-choice mechanic is a new `Kind` on the table plus its handling in
`allowedHouses`/`resolveHouseWagers`, not a new state slot.

## Generic counters are a global side-table, not a field per kind

Card-placed markers that only matter to the cards that read them — a doom counter
(Wretched Doll), and its kin — live in one global side-table on `GameState`
(`Counters [maxCounterEntries]CounterEntry` + `CounterCount`), not a bespoke
`int16` field on `CardCore` per kind. `CardCore` is copied whole into every
snapshot, so a field per kind would add hundreds of bytes to `FastCopy` for
markers that are almost always absent; the side-table costs nothing when empty.
The decision, its bound, and the rejected per-card layouts are ADR 0024.

To add a counter: one `CounterKind` value in `counter.go` with its display noun —
no rulebook term (the one "Generic Counters" entry covers them all), no new state
field, no per-kind resolver method. Place and read through the generic
`PlaceCounter{Kind, Target, Amount}` effect, the `CounterInPlay{Kind}` condition,
the `Target.WithCounter(kind)` filter, and the `PlaceCounter`/`CountersOn`
resolver methods. A per-card count folds into its entry's `N` (saturating), and a
card sheds every entry through the one `removeFromPlay` funnel. Do **not** add a
`FooCounters int16` to `CardCore` for a new marker. Power counters, damage, and
Æmber-on-card stay bespoke: they are read on the hot path by identity and change a
creature's power or fate, not markers a card names.

## Take control is a LIFO stack, not one source per card

"Take control" effects stack. Two abilities can seize the same card, and when the
newer one ends the older one — if still in effect — takes over; only when the last
ends does the card revert to its owner. Model this as the global control stack on
`GameState` (`Controls [maxControlEntries]ControlEntry` + `ControlCount`, in
`game_control.go`), the same flat, sparse, order-by-construction shape as the
counter side-table. A card's controller is the top entry naming it; `ControlPlus`
on `CardCore` is only the fast O(1) cache of that top, refreshed on every push and
pop. The decision and the bug it fixed (a single `ControlSource` reverting straight
to the owner, and artifacts never reverting) are ADR 0028.

To take control, push one entry through `takeControl(id, controller, source)` — it
handles creatures and artifacts alike. `source` is the card whose leaving play ends
the grant; an **UntilCardLeavesPlay** grant names the seized card itself as `source`, so it
lapses only when the card leaves play. A take first supersedes its own source's
earlier entry on the card (`supersedeControl` drops the matching `(card, source)`
pair), so re-taking replaces rather than stacks — this bounds the stack to the
distinct in-play sources per card, the board rather than the game length. Every
exit funnels through `removeFromPlay`, which calls `releaseControlHeldBy(id)` to
revert what the leaving card held and `clearControls(id)` to shed its own entries.
Do **not** add a second control field to `CardCore` or special-case artifacts; a
permanent grant is just a self-sourced stack entry.

## Power is dynamic: settle destruction after anything that can lower it

A creature's power is computed, not stored — base plus upgrades, power counters,
temporary bonuses, and the constant abilities in play (`Power` in `game_read.go`).
So a creature can become destroyable with **no effect touching it**: the card
buffing it leaves play, its `+power` counter is removed, an enemy blanks its text,
its owner unforges a key a `Per` count scaled on. `shouldDestroy` names that state
and `settleDestroyed` is what notices it — but only where it is called.

**Any code path that can lower a creature's power must end by settling
destruction.** When you add or change a mechanic that touches power — a new
counter, a constant, a blank, a control swap, a `Per`-scaled bonus, a card leaving
play — trace every way it can reduce a `Power` result and make sure the path ends
in `g.settleDestroyed(controller)` (directly, or through `removeFromPlay`, which
already settles). A missed settle does not fail loudly: it leaves a creature in
play with damage at or above its power, and the bug only surfaces turns later when
something else finally settles the board — exactly the kind of "in 2 places" or
"power above damage" invariant a sim soak trips. This has recurred often enough to
be a standing check: `AddPowerCounter`, `BlankEnemyText`, `SetAember`, and the
key-forge paths all settle for this reason; new siblings must too.

**When several cards leave play at once, they leave together.** An effect that
removes a batch of creatures (archive, destroy, return, shuffle) must not let the
first removal's settle destroy a later member of the same batch — Epic Quest
archives "Lion" Bautrem and the neighbor it was buffing simultaneously, so the
neighbor is archived, not destroyed for the power it just lost and then archived a
second time into two zones. Hold the `settling` flag across the batch and settle
once at the end (`destroyBatch`, `putIntoArchivesEach` are the models); never loop
a per-card leave-play call over a pre-selected list without batching.

**A card is not "destroyed" until it reaches the discard pile.** Resolving a
creature's `Destroyed:` abilities is a distinct, earlier timing window from the
creature _being destroyed_: during `destroyTogether` every dying creature stays in
play while the batch's `Destroyed:` abilities resolve, and only then does each go
to its discard pile. The **"after ... destroyed"** reactions
(`emitAfterCreatureDestroyed` for Neffru, `emitAfterEnemyDestroyed` for Pile of
Skulls) fire only after that move, so a creature killed in the same batch is out
of play and can neither be chosen by
those reactions nor react to the deaths beside it — e.g. Pile of Skulls cannot
capture onto a friendly creature that died in the same combat. Do not fire an
"after destroyed" reaction (or offer a prompt that could pick a dying creature)
inside the destruction window; wait until the batch is in the discard.

## Event, ability, and effect verbs: emit → trigger → resolve

Three tiers of verb, kept distinct so a method name says which level it works at:

- **`emit<Event>`** announces a game event and fans out to everything listening —
  `emitReapWindow`, `emitEnters`, `emitActionPlayedBeforeResolve`,
  `emitLeavesPlay`. Use it at an event site that dispatches to responders (triggered
  abilities and the lasting registry). The site folds its duration reactions into
  that event's trigger window with `lastingReactions`.
- **`trigger…`** resolves a _single card's_ abilities matching a trigger —
  `triggerAbilities(id, TriggerAfterReap, …)`. The emitters call into it per card.
- **`resolve…`** carries out one specific effect or ability — `Effect.Resolve`,
  `resolveReaction`, `resolveUpgradePlay`.

Reserve the domain word _"fire"_ for prose ("a trigger fires", "an ability
fires"): it is what an ability does in response to an emitted event, never the name
of a method that does the emitting.

## The game log is typed entries, not sentences

The log narrates what **resolved**, not what a card promised (ADR 0011). There is
no `Logf`: the engine cannot write a sentence into the log at all.

- **A new log line is a new `LogEntry` variant**, a small comparable struct in
  `log_<family>.go` (`log_aember.go`, `log_zone.go`, `log_play.go`, …) carrying the
  ids and amounts of the outcome plus a `Text(Namer) string` that words it. Record
  it with `g.record(entry)` (or `Resolver.Record` from inside an effect). Never
  format a name into a string at the call site — carry the `LocalID` and let
  `Text` ask the `Namer`, so the client can link the card and the log stays honest
  about hidden zones.
- **Attribution is a `Frame`, not a line.** "Because Bumpsy's Play ability said
  so" is not narration — it is context. Open a frame around the resolution
  (`closeFrame := g.openFrame(Frame{Actor, Source, Trigger, Grantor})`, deferred or
  called at the end) and every entry recorded inside inherits it. A card's printed
  text is never a log line.
- **Whole-tree passes over an entry are extrinsic**, the same Visitor rule as
  effects: `RenderEntry` splits a rendered entry into card-linkable segments from
  the outside, in `log_render.go`. Do not add a second method to every entry.
- **A `Text` method reuses the shared phrasing, it does not re-roll it.**
  `log.go` holds the helpers every entry draws on — `namedCards` for a list of card
  names, `because(text, on)` to suffix an event clause, `nameMoved` for a card
  crossing zones — and `text_helpers.go` holds `countNoun`/`plural` for "1 card" vs
  "3 cards" and `indefinite` for "a"/"an". Never hand-roll a `card(s)` placeholder,
  a `noun + "s"` plural, or a bare `"a " + noun`. When an entry is another entry
  plus context, build the base entry and render it: `LastingAemberGained.Text` is
  `because(AemberGained{…}.Text(n), e.On)`.
- **Whether a card may be named is decided by its zones, not by the entry.**
  `Zone.public()` says which zones both players can see (discard pile, the board,
  the purged pile — not a hand, archives, or a deck), and `nameMoved(n, id, from,
to)` names a card once either end of the move is public and calls it "a card"
  otherwise. An entry that narrates a zone change states the two zones and calls
  `nameMoved`; it never calls `Namer.Name` directly, so no one entry can leak a
  hand or a deck on its own initiative. A card in a hidden zone becomes nameable
  only through a `Reveal`, which records its own entry.
- **Discards resolve one at a time, so each is its own log line.** A "discard N"
  effect discards its cards individually, never as a batch, and the log reflects
  that — do not group several discards into one "discards X and Y" line. This is
  load-bearing for the (not-yet-built) scrap mechanic, which acts on each discard
  as it happens.
- Recording is switchable (`SetRecording`), so a search that plays thousands of
  games pays nothing for narration.

## Prompts: name the card, and let the player click a target

Every prompt the engine raises reaches a human, so write it as the card's own
sentence and route it through the channel a UI can render as a board interaction.

- **The active player makes every choice, always** — an unbreakable KeyForge rule.
  The chooser for a placement, a target, an order, or an option is `ActivePlayer`,
  even when the choice lands in the opponent's play area: which flank a Treachery
  creature or a give-to-opponent seize enters the opponent's battleline on, and
  where a creature put into play under the opponent lands, are all the active
  player's calls (rulebook: any time a creature enters play or changes control the
  active player chooses its flank). Never pass a controller that is not the active
  player as the chooser. A creature moving into a battleline funnels through one of
  the placement seams — `deployPosition`/`chooseFlank` (play and put-into-play),
  `placeGainedOnFlank` (control gains and gifts), `placeSeizedOnFlank` (the seize
  effect) — each of which asks the active player and never silently assumes a flank
  (ADR 0010). A new placement site routes through a seam rather than calling
  `Battleline[...].add` itself.
- **Ask through `pickCreature`/`pickCard`, not `ChooseOption`, whenever the answer
  is a card.** A card choice is made by clicking the card, so a frontend
  highlights the candidates and takes a click. A list of card _names_ as buttons is
  a fallback, not the design; only use `ChooseOption` when the options are not
  cards (a house, a key colour, "yes"/"no").
- **Refer to the source card with `SelfName`, never a literal name.** The engine
  substitutes the asking card's name into the prompt (`renderPrompt`), so
  `"fully heal "+SelfName` reads as "fully heal Chuff Ape" at runtime and matches
  the printed text. Hard-coding a name in a prompt is a one-off smell.
- **Phrase the prompt as the card's instruction**, lowercase and imperative
  ("choose a creature to attach {self} to"), so the prompt and the printed text
  are the same sentence.
- **When the choice is optional ("may", "up to N"), the player must be able to
  stop**: the prompt is declinable, and a frontend shows a _Done_ button beside
  the highlighted candidates. An optional choice must therefore **not** be
  short-circuited when only one candidate remains — that would take the choice
  away. `pickCreature` auto-takes a sole candidate precisely because it models a
  _mandatory_ choice; an optional one needs its own path.

These are conscious tradeoffs; the "why" is in the linked ADRs. Handle them as
described; do not "fix" them into a regression of a constraint.

- **Wide `Resolver`** (ADR 0008). Handled by the role-interface segregation above —
  add to the right role, and let a genuinely new cluster become a new role.
- **`Target` flag-soup + paired `x` / `hasX` fields** (ADR 0005). `Target` must
  stay comparable, which rules out a `[]filter` slice and `*int` optionals.
  Handled by: (a) route per-card filters through the existing builder methods
  (`WithTrait`, `OfHouse`, `PowerAtMost`, …); (b) route **set-relative** rules
  through `Refinement` instead of adding another field; (c) only add a new `Target`
  field when a per-card filter genuinely has no `Refinement` form. If the field count
  ever truly hurts, the in-constraint move is a single fixed-size comparable filter
  descriptor, **not** a slice.
- **Enum-tagged lasting records instead of stored closures** (ADR 0007). Handled by
  the flat-state-interpreter discipline above.
- **`panic` in `EffectContext.PlayerFor` on `playerUnset`** (ADR 0010). Acceptable
  **only** because `NewCard` runs `validate()` at init, so a real card can never
  reach it — the panic fires at authoring time, not mid-game. Never let a
  _computed_ `Player` reach `PlayerFor`; reject unset at the boundary.
- **`Game` as a large type implementing all of `Resolver`.** A single live-match
  façade, kept in check by the `game_*.go` file split (by area) and the `Resolver`
  role split (by capability). Add a `Game` method to the matching `game_*.go`; if
  an area outgrows its file, split the file, don't grow the type's responsibilities
  silently.

## Before you add: check the surface that already exists

The `1 keys` bug — a hand-rolled plural, because `countNoun` already existed and
was not found — is the failure this catalog prevents. A helper, a log phrase, or a
read you are about to write is usually already here. Each entry names the
**authority file** (enumerate it; do not trust this list to be complete) and the
load-bearing names you must not re-invent.

- **Word a number or a name — `text_helpers.go`.** `countNoun(n, noun)` for
  "1 key" vs "2 keys" (never `noun+"s"`, never a bare `if n == 1`), `plural(n, noun)`,
  `indefinite(noun)` for "a"/"an". Enumerate: `grep -n '^func ' internal/engine/text_helpers.go`.
- **Word a log line — `log.go`.** `namedCards` (a list of card names),
  `because(text, on)` (suffix an event clause), `nameMoved(n, id, from, to)` (a
  card crossing zones, silent on hidden ones). Never format a `Namer.Name` into a
  string at the call site. A new line is a new `LogEntry` variant in the matching
  `log_<family>.go` — find the family first: `grep -rln 'Namer) string' internal/engine/log_*.go`.
- **Settle destruction — `game_settle.go` / `game_leaves_play.go`.** Anything that
  can lower power ends in `settleDestroyed`; any exit funnels `removeFromPlay`. Do
  not re-derive destruction inline (see "Power is dynamic" above).
- **Read legality or a derived stat — `game_read.go`, `game_play.go`,
  `game_abilities.go`.** `Power(id)`, `CanPlay`/`CanDiscard`/`CanUse`. Add a read to
  the matching `game_*.go` and its `Resolver` role; enumerate the role before
  adding a method.
- **Assert a new outcome narrates — `internal/sim`.** The step-narration invariant
  fails when a step changes state without recording a `LogEntry`, so a new
  state-changing outcome needs its log line, not only its mutation.

Then work the decision order below.

## Adding a mechanic: the decision order

1. Can an existing `Effect` express it by changing a `Target`, `Count`,
   `Condition`, or `Refinement`? Prefer that — no new type.
2. Is it a new _node_? Add an `Effect` (or `Condition`/`Count`/`Refinement`) in the
   matching `effect_*.go` / `target.go`, with `Text()` + `Resolve()` (+ `validate()`
   if it has an illegal field combo), and a facade alias in `internal/card`.
3. Does it need a new engine capability? Add the method to the right `Resolver`
   role interface and implement it on `*Game` in the matching `game_*.go`.
4. Is it "for the remainder of the turn"? Route it through the lasting registry,
   not the play/reap path.
5. Is it an extrinsic whole-tree operation (AI, analysis)? A type-switch function,
   not a new interface method.
6. Does it need to say what happened? A `LogEntry` variant in `log_<family>.go`,
   recorded at the site the outcome actually lands — never a formatted sentence.

Keep everything green including 100% `internal/engine` coverage
(`mage ci:fix && mage ci:check`).
