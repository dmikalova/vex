// This file gives the 11 root actions a Command representation's other half: a
// single place to PERFORM one (ApplyAction). ADR 0039 defines a Command as "a root
// action or one answer to a choice", but the answer kinds in suspend.go left the
// root half unexpressed — so a driver that already speaks Command (internal/session)
// could answer a choice but not initiate a play. ApplyAction closes that: it maps
// each root Command onto the engine method the matching player click calls,
// mirroring the web client's proven dispatchRoot so that hand-rolled driver can
// fold into this one (ADR 0040). It is the seam the canonical turn loop applies a
// player's chosen action through.

// ErrNotRootAction is returned by ApplyAction for a Command whose Kind is a choice
// answer rather than one of the root actions it performs.

// method the corresponding player click calls. The action's player is the active
// player, as it was when the command was chosen. It returns the engine's own error
// for an illegal play (wrong house, no target, exhausted, ...) so a driver can
// surface it, and ErrNotRootAction for a Command that is not a root action.

// RunMatch is the canonical turn loop (ADR 0039, 0040): it deals the game, then

// standing Action a real match hands the session, so a client no longer hand-rolls
// its own turn driver — each yielded RequestAction is one click, and ApplyAction
// folds the answer back in.
//
// Because the loop owns setup, first player is a decision the loop asks for and
// records rather than an argument it is handed, so a match's whole input — the
// opening roll included — lives in its command log; and the mulligan prompts
// StartGame raises surface through the same choosers as every later decision, so
// they are recorded answers
// like any other. Between actions it hands off a turn an effect ended without
// pairing a StartTurn — the Omega keyword ends the play phase mid-action, and
// EndTurn (Book of leQ) jumps to the end-of-turn phase — so the loop resumes on the
// next player's turn rather than asking for an action in a phase that has none.
