goes when played and how it is used.

(flavor labels such as _Knight_ or _Robot_ that other cards reference but that
carry no rules of their own), and its rules text. Creatures additionally show a

half, which carries only its bonus icons. You need both halves to play it. Play
either half and the whole creature enters your battleline as one creature; the
base half stands in the battleline and the art half sits beside it. Both halves
count as one creature for every rule. When it leaves play, both halves go
together to the same place.`,
