// A card whose ability names a house nearly always names its own: Battle Fleet,
// a Mars card, reveals Mars cards; Pitlord, a Dis card, locks you into Dis;
// Witch of the Wilds, an Untamed card, lets you play an Untamed card off-house.
// Writing the house out a second time lets the two drift, so the author writes
// the SelfHouse sentinel and the card's own house is filled in here, once, when
// the definition is built. Only a card that names a *different* house — one that
// really is about Sanctum rather than about itself — spells that house out.

// selfHouseResolvable is implemented by the value types that keep part of a card
// definition in unexported fields (KeyCostChange, powerLessThan). Reflection can
// read but never write those, so such a type resolves its own sentinels,
// delegating back to replacedIn for whatever effect-tree node it holds. A type
// that exports its fields needs none of this: Target's Filter and Refinement are
// exported, so the reflection pass descends into them like any other struct.

// (TestNoCardHardcodesItsOwnHouse) guarantees a card never spells its own printed
// house out, so every reference to it came from card.House.Self — which is why a
// rehoused Maverick's ability names the house it is now printed in, not the one it
