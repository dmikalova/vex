// This file holds the log's sample catalog (ADR 0046): one representative value
// of every LogEntry variant the game can narrate. It is the log counterpart to
// Keywords() — a closed, enumerable set co-located with the entries it names — so
// a consumer that wants to show or exercise "every kind of log line" has a single
// source to draw from rather than reconstructing the set by playing games.
//
// The catalog is kept complete by a totality test (TestLogEntrySamplesTotality):
// a variant with no sample fails the build. Its wording is pinned, index for
// index, by TestLogEntryText, which renders every sample and asserts its text.
// So this list and that test move together — adding a variant means adding a
// sample here and its wording there, and a mismatch is loud.

// LogEntrySamples returns one representative value of every LogEntry variant, in
// a stable order grouped the way the log families are. The gallery uses it as
// the catalog it covers real games against, falling back to a sample's own
// rendering for a variant a game run never produced (ADR 0046).
