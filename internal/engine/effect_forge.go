// ForgeKey has a player forge a key outside the normal start-of-turn step. By
// default the controller forges, paying the current key cost if they can afford it;
// FreeOfCost forges without paying. Player: Opponent instead forces the opponent to
// forge a key at no cost (Turnkey), and the active player — who chooses everything —
// picks its colour; that forced forge spends nothing, so it never purges a source.
// Both controller paths fire "after you forge a key" abilities and, on the final
// key, win the game. A controller forge that lands purges the card that made it —
// every forge outside the normal step spends its source (a Vex divergence; see
// "Key cheats purge themselves" in docs/keyforge-divergences.md).
//
// That purge is deliberate and overrides the printed text. Of the 17 cards that
// forge through this node, 15 print no self-removal at all and two print
// "sacrifice"; the rule applies to all of them, and the node carries no opt-out
// flag. A generated "-> purge <self>" that the printed card text does not mention
// is the rule working, not a bug — the register entry says why it is upheld.
