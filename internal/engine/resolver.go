// Resolver is the complete interface an effect uses to inspect and change the
// game. Effects hold only a Resolver (through EffectContext) — never the *Game or
// its GameState — so every change a card is able to make goes through one of
// these methods, the full explicit catalogue of what an effect may do; *Game
// implements it.
//
// The catalogue is deliberately wide, so it is composed from the focused role
// interfaces below (reads, economy, creature state, combat, zones, turn-scoped
// grants, choices, logging). An effect or a test double can depend on just the
// role it needs, and each new mechanic adds its method to the matching role —
// which keeps the capability clusters, and any gaps worth refactoring, visible in
// one place. Add a method to the role it belongs to, not to a flat list.
