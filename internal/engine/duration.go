// the same way a Target says which cards an effect reaches.

	RemainderOfPlayerTurn
	// OpponentNextTurn is dormant for the rest of this turn and bites only during
	// the affected player's next turn — typically the opponent's — lifting when that
	// turn ends (Fogbank: the opponent cannot fight during their next turn). It
	// waits for that player's next turn however many turns intervene, so an extra
	// turn taken by someone else never consumes it. Contrast StartOfPlayerNextTurn,
	// which is live now rather than dormant.
	OpponentNextTurn
	// StartOfPlayerNextTurn is live the moment it is established and stays live
	// through the opponent's turn, lifting at the start of the caster's next turn
	// (their start-of-turn phase) — so a defensive effect survives the opponent's
	// turn (Into the Night, Sow Salt, Diplomacy). It lifts at the same boundary as
	// OpponentNextTurn but, unlike it, is in force from the moment it resolves.
	StartOfPlayerNextTurn
	// EndOfPlayerNextTurn lasts from now through the end of the affected player's
	// own next turn, then lifts. "Next turn" is that player's next turn — not the
	// next turn any player takes — so for the controller the window covers the rest
	// of this turn, the opponent's intervening turn, and the whole of the
	// controller's next turn, lifting only when that turn ends. Unlike
	// OpponentNextTurn — which waits for that next turn before it bites — this
	// window is live the moment it is established and stays live across the
	// intervening turns, so it suits a reduction a player wants in force immediately
	// (We Can ALL Win's key-cost drop).
	EndOfPlayerNextTurn
	// UntilThisLeavesPlay lasts until the card whose effect established it leaves
	// play (Collar of Subordination's control change), rather than expiring at a
	// turn boundary. The leave-play teardown honors it.
	UntilThisLeavesPlay
	// UntilCardLeavesPlay lasts until the affected card itself leaves play, rather
	// than until the effect's own source does (Sneklifter's control of a seized
	// artifact). It registers no timed teardown: the effect anchors to the affected
	// card and is shed only when that card leaves play, so it holds for as long as the
	// card stays in play. It is the sibling of UntilThisLeavesPlay, which anchors
	// instead to the source card whose effect established it.
	//
	// Design rule — "the latest ability wins": when two effects change the same
	// thing on the same card (control, house), the most recently applied one is in
	// force. Control is a single last-write-wins field, so a later take-control
	// simply overrides an UntilCardLeavesPlay one. If a *timed* override is ever
	// layered over an UntilCardLeavesPlay effect, its expiry must fall back to that
	// effect rather than to the owner's default — the UntilCardLeavesPlay effect still
	// governs once the timed one lifts. (Today artifact control is only ever
	// UntilCardLeavesPlay, so no such timed override exists yet; this rule is the
	// invariant to preserve when one is added.)
