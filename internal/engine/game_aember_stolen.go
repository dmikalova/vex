// EmitAemberStolenFrom fires each of the victim's in-play After Æmber Is Stolen
// From You abilities once Æmber has been stolen from them, carrying the amount
// taken in that single theft so an ability can scale by it (Molephin deals 1
// damage to each enemy creature for each Æmber stolen). A theft of nothing, or
// from the other player, fires nothing.
//
// The scan is row-only: it is a reaction emit, and triggeredBy already reaches an
// upgrade's text through its host, so walking upgrades as well would fire the same
// printed text twice (docs/adr/0048-upgrade-in-play-not-an-ability-source.md).
