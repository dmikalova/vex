description: Get `mage ci:fix && mage ci:check` fully green, then stage, commit, and push the work in one go. Use when the user wants to finish up by verifying the gate and committing ("check and commit", "/check-and-commit", "get it green and push").
---

This skill takes the repo from "work in progress" to "pushed", in order:

1. Run `mage ci:fix`, then get `mage ci:check` to print `ALL GREEN`.
2. Stage everything, commit, and push.

**This skill is the one exception to the repo's "leave git alone" rule.** The
user has explicitly asked for the commit and push, so run them — but only as the
final step, only after the gate is green, and only within this skill.

## 1. Get `mage ci:check` green

Apply every autofix, then run the full gate:

```sh
mage ci:fix && mage ci:check
```

`ci:fix` formats, runs `go fix`, golangci-lint `--fix`, the Markdown and
spelling fixers, and regenerates the generated configs. `ci:check` writes
nothing: it fails on anything `ci:fix` would still change, then builds (host and
js/wasm), vets, lints, markdown-lints, spell-checks, scans for secrets, lints the
branch's commit messages, checks the generated configs for drift, tests, and
coverage-checks the whole tree (all four gated areas must stay at 100%). It must
print `ALL GREEN`.

If it fails, fix the cause and run it again. Repeat until it is green. Do **not**
advance to the commit while anything is red, and do **not** reach for the
escape hatches the repo forbids: never delete or weaken a failing test to get to
green, and never bypass a check (`--no-verify` and the like). A red gate is a
real problem to solve, not an obstacle to route around.

Common fixes:

- Formatting, lint-autofix, Markdown or spelling drift — `ci:check` never writes,
  so run `mage ci:fix` and re-run the gate before hand-editing.
- Generated config drift (`ci:drift`) — a generated file (`.golangci.yaml`,
  `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`, `.ruleguard.go`, ...) was edited by hand. Move the
  change into `mklv.config.json`, then `mage ci:fix`.
- A spelling false positive (`ci:spell`) on a card name or KeyForge term — add a
  narrow `tools.misspell.ignore` entry in `mklv.config.json`, never "correct"
  the printed name.
- Stale generated output — run `mage gen` if a card comment or the rulebook is
  out of date, then re-run the gate.
- Coverage below 100% in a gated area — add the missing test for the new code.
  See "Closing a coverage gap" below for the exact commands to find the red line.

### Closing a coverage gap

`mage ci:cover` reports each gated area's total and, when one is below 100%, names
every function still short with its percentage. To turn that into "the exact
uncovered line", generate a profile and read the zero-count blocks — do **not**
guess which branch is missing:

1. **Get the per-function shortfall.** `mage ci:cover` is authoritative and prints
   the offenders. To iterate faster on one area, profile it directly with the same
   flags as its gate (`ci.CoverGates` in `magefiles/build.go`; the gates run
   without the `assert` build tag, so do not add it or the numbers drift):

   ```sh
   cd internal/engine &&
     go test -coverprofile=tmp/eng.cov . &&
     go tool cover -func=tmp/eng.cov | grep -v '100.0%'
   ```

   (Use `tmp/` inside the repo, not the system `/tmp` — but delete the scratch
   profile before the gate, since `mage ci:check` walks the whole tree.)

2. **Find the uncovered line, not the function.** The `-func` view gives a
   percentage; the profile itself gives the line. Each block line is
   `file:startLine.col,endLine.col numStmts count` — a trailing `0` is an
   unexecuted block. Filter to the function's line range:

   ```sh
   awk -F: '$0 ~ /text.go/ && $2>=837 && $2<=913' tmp/eng.cov | grep ' 0$'
   ```

   Then open that line and see which branch it is — an untaken `if`, a `default`
   arm, a `break` when candidates run out before a max, a flag field never set
   true. Write one focused test that drives exactly that branch.

3. **Confirm and clean up.** Re-run the `-func` filter to see the function hit
   100%, then delete the scratch profile so it does not linger in the tree:

   ```sh
   go tool cover -func=tmp/eng.cov | grep '<funcName>' && rm -f tmp/eng.cov
   cd - >/dev/null && mage ci:cover   # authoritative: all four areas at 100.0%
   ```

### Diagnosing a sim / `FuzzPlay` failure

When the gate fails inside `internal/sim` (a `FuzzPlay/<seed>` case reporting an
`invariant violated ...` line), the failure is a whole simulated game, not a
single unit. Work it like this:

1. **Find the failing seed and its script.** Run the sim tests alone and read
   the failure — it prints the seed and the long `script:` hex:

   ```sh
   go test ./internal/sim/ 2>&1 | tail -30
   ```

2. **Replay the script with the game log.** Stash the hex in a shell var (it is
   long) and replay it. `mage debug` prints **both players' full deck lists**
   above the log tail, which is the whole point — the invariant names the victim,
   not the culprit:

   ```sh
   S=<script-hex-from-the-failure>
   mage debug -script=$S -tail=60
   ```

   Widen `-tail`, or dump the whole game to a file to read it end to end:

   ```sh
   mage debug -script=$S -tail=100000 > tmp/sim/bug.txt 2>&1
   grep -nE 'deck \(|VIOLATION' tmp/sim/bug.txt   # deck lists + the violation
   ```

3. **Suspect the mechanic, then find the card that carries it.** Read _both_
   decks, not only the cards in the log tail. Scan every card for the mechanic
   that could produce the bad state — a power reducer for a 0-power creature, a
   blanker for a creature that lost its ability, an attachment for a stat that
   drifted. A creature that dies (or fails to die) "for no reason" almost always
   lost or gained a constant a card that has since left the tail was granting.
   Grep the log for a suspect by name to see its whole lifecycle:

   ```sh
   grep -niE 'King of the Crag|Bingle|Shadow of Dis' tmp/sim/bug.txt
   ```

4. **Fix the mechanic, not the seed.** Never delete or weaken the invariant or
   the seed to get green. Once you find the root cause, add a focused engine or
   card regression test that fails before the fix and passes after (prove it:
   run the new test, revert the fix, watch it fail, restore the fix), then
   confirm the seed passes:

   ```sh
   go test ./internal/sim/ 2>&1 | tail -5
   ```

## 2. Stage, commit, and push

Only once `mage ci:check` prints `ALL GREEN`, run the commit and push exactly as
the user asked (the lefthook pre-commit hook runs `mage ci:check` again):

```sh
git add -A && git commit -a -m "feat: implement cards" && git push
```

Then report the pushed commit and stop. Do not amend, force-push, rebase, or
touch history — this skill's entire git footprint is the single add-commit-push
above.
