name: refactor-sweep
description: Sweep a bounded area of this repo for refactors and cleanup — decompose fused effects, consolidate near-duplicates, comment what the names do not carry, split oversized files, regroup misplaced code, hunt bugs and anti-patterns — then ratchet each finding into the docs so it cannot come back. Use when the user wants code refactored, cleaned up, tidied, simplified, audited, or reorganized.
---

A **sweep** takes one bounded area, collects every **finding** in it, fixes them
cheapest-first, and then **ratchets** each one: writes the rule that made it a
finding into the doc that governs that area, so the next agent does not
reintroduce it. A sweep that only fixes code is half a sweep — the same shapes
grow back within a few rounds of card work.

Read the root `AGENTS.md` and `docs/style-guide.md` before starting; read
`internal/engine/AGENTS.md`, `internal/cards/AGENTS.md`, or
`internal/web/AGENTS.md` for whichever area the sweep covers. Those four files
plus `docs/style-guide.md` are both the standard you judge against and the place
most ratchets land.

## 1. Bound the sweep

Restate the area before touching code: a package (`internal/engine`), a family
(`effect_*.go`), a single file, or a class of finding across the repo ("every
struct field that needs a comment"). An unbounded "clean things up" means the
package the user was last working in.

Other agents work this tree at the same time. Sweep only files you can see are
settled — if `mage ci:check` fails on a symbol you never touched, that is someone
else mid-change, so leave it, say so, and sweep elsewhere.

## 2. Survey before deciding

Gather the candidate list first; picking findings by memory finds only the file
you just read.

```sh
mage ci:check                                # the baseline: know what was already red
mage ci:lint                                 # golangci-lint: unused code, shadowing, staticcheck
wc -l $(git ls-files '<area>/*.go' | grep -v _test) | sort -rn | head -20
grep -rn 'fmt\.Print\|println(\|TODO\|FIXME\|XXX' <area> --include='*.go' | grep -v _test
git status --porcelain                       # stray uncommitted files
```

Undocumented struct fields (a candidate list, not a to-do list — comment only the
ones whose name does not carry them):

```sh
awk '/^type .* struct \{/{s=1;next} /^\}/{s=0} s && /^\t[A-Za-z]/ && prev !~ /^\t*\/\// {print FILENAME":"FNR": "$0} {prev=$0}' $(git ls-files '<area>/*.go' | grep -v _test)
```

Atoms fused to an operator (a disjunction welded into one node's name — split into
atoms plus a combinator), and types named for a card rather than a mechanic (a
fusion tell):

```sh
grep -rnE 'type [A-Z][A-Za-z]*(Or|And)[A-Z]' <area> --include='*.go' | grep -v _test
```

Then read the area's files end to end. The greps find debris; the findings that
matter — a fused effect, a rule reimplemented in the client, a file that has
become two files — only show up in a read.

## 3. What counts as a finding

Judge against `docs/style-guide.md` and the area's `AGENTS.md`. Each class below
names what to hunt; all of them are worth a pass in any sweep.

**Fusion.** One node doing what composition should. "A, then B if C" belongs in
the card as `Sequence{A, Conditional{C, B}}`, with values threaded through
`EffectContext` (`ctx.It`, `ctx.ChosenHouse`, `ctx.Produced.*`) — not inside a
bespoke effect. A node named after a card rather than a mechanic is the loudest
tell. But not every multi-step node is fusion: some are **one atomic semantic op**
and must not be split — do not re-propose decomposing `EndTurn` (the end-turn
sequence is a single action) or `GainTextBox` (one op). The reverse is the model
to imitate: `MakeItsHouseActive` was a card-named fusion tell and correctly became
the mechanic `ChangeActiveHouse{To: HouseChoice}`.

**Atomization.** A predicate or amount that welds two atoms to an operator is a
combinator waiting to be extracted: a condition named for the two questions it
asks (`TraitOrAember`) splits into atoms plus a shared `Or{…}` (over conditions)
or `OrAmount` (over amounts), so any future pair composes for free. The operator
has to compose at the **clause boundary** — each atom renders a self-contained
clause under a shared prefix (every `CondText` starts `"if "`), so `Or` strips the
prefix and rejoins (`"if A or B"`). Disjunction and a guarded alternate amount
(`"steal 1, or 2 if …"`) qualify; **negation does not** — "it is not on a flank"
infixes the "not" inside the clause, so a generic `Not{}` cannot build it from
"it is on a flank", and the sense stays a `Not bool` on the atom that renders its
own negated text. A `Not bool` field is a feature, not a fusion. The tell that a
combinator exists but is unused is a fresh one-off whose job is a disjunction
`Or` already expresses.

**Duplication.** Two effects differing by a constant or a side are one effect
parameterized over an enum; two conditions asking the same question of different
subjects are one condition with a `Player`; two card files repeating a five-line
ability want a shared composite. Retire the shape you replaced and re-express its
callers in the same commit. But not every family is duplication. A **pure**
predicate or count (a `Met`/`Value` plus its text, no side effect) folds onto an
enum-keyed switch freely — `PoolAember{Player, Is}` is one node over five
comparisons, and the per-player "... this way" tallies fold into
`ProducedThisWay{Tally, Player}`. What stays separate is a family whose
**resolution** diverges (a different `Resolve` path or side effect) or that
**binds context** differently (one leaves `it`, another does not): merging those
is a branchy blob switching inside `Resolve`, not one mechanic (the random/top
discard verbs). A **partial convention** — merging a subset of a family and
leaving siblings as focused types — is a caution to weigh, not a veto: the "...
this way" tallies merged even though the simpler whole-tally counts
(`CardsDestroyed`) stayed separate, because the merged subset shared one rendering
shape. Merge an effect family only when the variants collapse to one render and
one resolution bar a single enum-selected noun (`ArchiveTopOfDeck` +
`ArchiveTopOfDiscard` → `ArchiveTop{From Zone}`).

**Scattered plumbing (thin verbs over a solid internal mechanism).** Sometimes
sibling verbs are _not_ mergeable — each prints its own text, filters its own way,
reveals or gates differently — yet they hand-roll the **same underlying
machinery**: the same zone probes, the same dispatch table, the same drain-and-
refill loop. The fix is not to merge the nodes (their identity diverges, per the
Duplication rule above) and not to leave the machinery copied four times. Extract
the machinery into one **solid internal (unexported) mechanism** and leave each
verb a **thin authoring wrapper** that supplies only its own identity and
delegates the plumbing. The card call sites and printed text do not change; only
the duplicated resolve/dispatch logic collapses to one place. Tells: several nodes
whose `Resolve` bodies share a membership-probe-then-`switch` shape (a cross-zone
move dispatched by which zone a card sits in — `crossZoneMover`), or repeat a
gather-pick-place loop (`placeAmong`). Pass any axis the mechanism needs
**explicitly** — do not have it infer, say, a destination from where a card sat;
the verb names the destination, the mechanism only carries it out. This is the
resolution to reach for whenever "these are clearly the same operation" collides
with "but I can't merge them without a branchy `Resolve`."

**Unification (one engine behind sibling facades).** A narrower cousin of
scattered plumbing: two nodes that render and resolve _differently_ but along one
thin axis — a sign, a constant, a single enum — should share one parameterized
helper rather than copy the template. `RaiseKeyCost` and `LowerKeyCost` keep
their separate verb identities but both delegate to one `keySurchargeText` (passed
`"+"`/`"-"`) and one `armKeyCost` (a lower is a negated raise), so the sentence
template and the resolution cannot drift between them. This is **Parameterize
Function**: the axis is so thin it is a scalar argument — a _degenerate Strategy_,
not a Strategy object. The tell is two sibling `Text()` methods (or two `Resolve`
bodies) that are line-for-line the same but for one literal; fold the shared body
into a helper the axis parameterizes and leave each facade a one-line delegate.
When the siblings instead share their whole _shape_ — the same struct fields, the
same skeleton of steps, but a few steps genuinely differ — that is a **Template
Method**: extract the skeleton once and let the differing steps be a Strategy seam
(a `Chooser`/`Refinement`/`Count`/`Condition`) or, in Go, an embedded common
struct, rather than repeating the skeleton per sibling. Either way the facades and
their card call sites do not change; only the duplicated template collapses.

**Ladder violations.** A change belongs at the cheapest rung that can carry it: a
field or Strategy on an existing effect (a `Count`, `Refinement`, `Condition`,
`Chooser`) beats a new node; a new node beats a new `Resolver` capability; that
beats new state. A new node that only varies an existing one along one axis is a
Strategy wearing a node's clothes.

**Misplacement.** `internal/engine`'s filenames are its index: `game_*.go` is
`*Game` methods only, `effect_<mechanic>.go` is one mechanic, and any other
concept gets its own `<concept>.go`. A `Game` method in an `effect_` file, an
enum living inside `game_`, a `Resolver` method on the wrong role interface, and
a rule reimplemented in `internal/web` instead of read from the engine are all
findings.

**Oversized files.** A file past ~250 lines is a prompt to look, not a defect. It
earns a split only when it holds two concepts that a reader would look for
separately; split along that seam and name each half for its concept. Test files
split the same way as their source.

**Missing comments.** The repo's rule is one short line stating what the code
cannot show on its own. A finding is a type, field, or function whose _why_,
unit, invariant, or zero-value meaning is unstated — not one whose name already
says it. Rewrite a comment that restates its next line rather than adding another.

**Missing rulebook entries.** A player-facing mechanic with no `RuleTerm` in
`internal/engine/ruleterms_<section>.go` is a finding: it is
absent from the `/rulebook` page, so a player cannot look it up.
Judge what is player-facing against `docs/keyforge-master-rulebook.md` — if the
official rulebook explains the term to a player, ours must too. Sections are
`turn`, `combat`, `cardtype`, `keyword`, `ability`, and `effect`; the term's `Body`
is the entry's text, and a `Subtitle` groups several
code sites under one `Title`. An entry whose text no longer matches what the code
does, and a directive left on a mechanic a refactor retired, are findings of the
same class. List the gaps with:

```sh
grep -Ln 'rulebook:' internal/engine/effect_*.go | grep -v _test
```

**Voice drift.** Every player-facing string is written in one controlled Rules
voice (ADR 0019): a card's `Text()`, a log entry's `Text(Namer)`, a rulebook
`Body`, a prompt — short declarative sentences, one instruction each, controlled
vocabulary (one word per meaning), the resource spelled Æmber. A finding is any
string that breaks the voice or renders the same act two ways. Read a card's
`Text()` beside the log its `Resolve()` emits and check they name the same act the
same way: the same **grammatical voice** for the same mechanic (a random discard
is the discarding player's own act — "your opponent discards a random card," not
the imperative "discard a random card from your opponent's hand" one sibling away;
this is exactly the discard fold's unified voice), the same **verb** for the same
mechanic (never a synonym the KeyForge vernacular already fixes — `exhaust` not
"tap", `purge` not "exile", `return` not "bounce", `Æmber` not "mana"), and a log
that narrates the **resolved outcome**, not the intent (ADR 0011 — "gains 2Æ," not
"tries to gain 2Æ"). The wording authority order is Vex's own conventions
([card-wording-rules.md](../../../docs/card-wording-rules.md)) → the divergence
register ([keyforge-divergences.md](../../../docs/keyforge-divergences.md)) → the
KeyForge Master Rulebook; a deliberate departure not in the register is a finding,
and so is a "match KeyForge" that silently overwrites a departure the register
records. A cheap first pass for the banned synonyms (read each hit — some are
legitimate, e.g. a Mana trait name):

```sh
grep -rniE '\b(tap|untap|exile|bounce|mana|strongest|weakest)\b' <area> --include='*.go' | grep -v _test
```

**Bugs and loopholes.** Read for the ones tests miss: a zero value that is a legal
value and so cannot signal "unset" (ADR 0010 — validate at init, pair a value with
`hasX`), an unchecked bound or index, a `Target` compared against state that has
stopped being comparable, an effect whose `Text()` no longer matches what
`Resolve()` does, a lasting effect that clears on the wrong turn, an error
swallowed instead of returned.

**Dead weight.** Unused exports, a helper with one caller that should be inlined,
a stub file left after the real implementation landed, a debug print, an orphan
file with no obvious owner.

## 4. Fix cheapest-first, and keep the suite honest

Order the findings by blast radius and take the cheap ones first: comments and
deletions, then in-file moves, then file splits, then reshaping an effect, then
touching a seam (`Resolver`, `GameState`, the `card` facade) last. Land each one
green rather than batching a dozen unverified edits.

The card and engine tests pin both behavior and rendered text, so refactor
freely — but a test that goes red is evidence. Never delete, skip, or weaken one
to reach green; either fix your change, or state the rule that makes the old
expectation wrong before rewriting the test to assert the new correct behavior.

A wording change means editing the effect's `Text()` in
`internal/engine/effect_*.go` and re-running `mage generateComments`; card doc
comments are generated and hand-edits are overwritten.

Renames go through the language server, never `sed`/`perl` — see "Navigate and
rename through the Go language server" in `AGENTS.md`. A sweep renames a lot, so
its two traps bite here hardest: aim the rename with a locator unique enough to
name its owner, and `git diff` after each one. A rename that lands on the wrong
same-named field still compiles and still passes the suite.

## 5. Ratchet every finding

For each finding, ask what would stop it coming back, and act on the answer.
Findings cluster: three instances of one shape mean the rule was never written
down, and writing it is worth more than the three fixes.

- A rule about **style, naming, or composition** → `docs/style-guide.md`.
- A rule about **where code goes**, or a structural fact about the repo → the
  root `AGENTS.md`.
- A rule about an **engine seam** (effect AST, Strategy, `Resolver` roles, flat
  state) → `internal/engine/AGENTS.md`.
- A rule about **authoring a card or its test** → `internal/cards/AGENTS.md`.
- A rule about **the client** (prompts, handlers, snapshots, CSS) →
  `internal/web/AGENTS.md`.
- A rule about **printed card text** → `docs/card-wording-rules.md`.
- A rule a **player** needs, about a mechanic the engine now has → a `RuleTerm`
  in the matching `internal/engine/ruleterms_<section>.go` (ADR 0018), so the
  `/rulebook` page picks it up.
- A **decision with real tradeoffs** you had to weigh → a new `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`,
  with the alternatives you rejected and why. Point at it from the AGENTS file
  that governs the area.
- A **new term** you found yourself explaining → `CONTEXT.md`.

Write the positive rule ("author an Omni ability as `Versatile` plus a
`Trigger.Action`"), not the ban. Prune while you are in there: a sweep that
corrects a doc should also delete the line the correction made stale, and a rule
that now contradicts the code is itself a finding.

A one-off with no general rule behind it ratchets to nothing. Say so and move on
rather than inventing a rule to have written one.

A **rejected** refactor ratchets too. When you weigh a merge or a move and decide
_against_ it — a consolidation that would become a branchy blob, an atomization no
card yet needs — write the decision (and why) where the next sweep will read it,
so it is not re-proposed every round. "Do not merge X and Y" is as much a rule as
"merge X and Y."

## 6. Close green and report

```sh
mage gen && mage ci:fix && mage ci:check  # gen = card comments; check must print ALL GREEN
```

The `/rulebook` page is the reader-facing summary of the rules the sweep touched;
an unexpected term appearing or vanishing there is a mechanic the sweep moved
without meaning to.

`mage ci:check` includes the 100% coverage gates, `internal/engine` among them: new engine code
needs its test in the matching `internal/engine/effect_*_test.go` or
`game_*_test.go`.

Report the sweep as a table of findings — what it was, where, what you did, and
what you ratcheted (or why nothing) — so the ratchets are reviewable as a set.
Then hand back, or bound the next area.
